</code></pre><h3 id="1-internal-storage">1. Internal Storage</h3>
<h5 id="11-internal-structure">1.1 Internal Structure</h5>
<p>The JAVA HashMap class implements the interface Map<k,v>. The main methods of this interface are:</k,v></p>
<ul>
<li>V put(K key, V value)</li>
<li>V get(Object key)</li>
<li>V remove(Object key)</li>
<li>Boolean containsKey(Object key)</li>
</ul>
<p>HashMaps use an inner class to store data: the <code>Entry&lt;K, V&gt;</code>. This entry is a simple key-value pair with two extra data:</p>
<ul>
<li>A reference to another Entry so that a HashMap can store entries like singly linked lists</li>
<li>A hash value that represents the hash value of the key. This hash value is stored to avoid the computation of the hash every time the HashMap needs it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a part of the Entry implementation in JAVA 7:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-java">static class Entry&lt;K,V&gt; implements Map.Entry&lt;K,V&gt; {
final K key;
V value;
Entry&lt;K,V&gt; next;
int hash;
&#x2026;
}
</code></pre>
<h5 id="12-how-to-crud-data">1.2 How to CRUD data</h5>
<p>A HashMap stores data into multiple singly linked lists of entries. All the lists are registered in an array of Entry (<code>Entry&lt;K,V&gt;[] array</code>) and the default capacity of this inner array is <code>16</code>.
<img src="../../assets/hashmap-ex.png" alt=""></p>
<p>All the keys with the same hash value are put in the same linked list (bucket). Keys with different hash values can end-up in the same bucket.</p>
<p>When a user calls <code>put(K key, V value)</code> or <code>get(Object key)</code>, the function computes the index of the bucket in which the Entry should be. Then, the function iterates through the list to look for the Entry that has the same key (using the equals() function of the key).</p>
<p>In the case of the <code>get()</code>, the function returns the value associated with the entry (if the entry exists).</p>
<p>In the case of the <code>put(K key, V value)</code>, if the entry exists the function replaces it with the new value otherwise it creates a new entry (from the key and value in arguments) at the head of the singly linked list.</p>
<h5 id="13-how-to-calculate-hashcode">1.3 How to calculate hashCode</h5>
<p>This index of the bucket (linked list) is generated in 3 steps by the map:</p>
<ul>
<li>It first gets the hashcode of the key.</li>
<li>It rehashes the hashcode to prevent against a bad hashing function from the key that would put all data in the same index (bucket) of the inner array</li>
<li>It takes the rehashed hash hashcode and bit-masks it with the length (minus 1) of the array. This operation assures that the index can&#x2019;t be greater than the size of the array. You can see it as a very computationally optimized modulo function.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the JAVA 7 and 8 source code that deals with the index:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-java">// JAVA 7: the &quot;rehash&quot; function
static int hash(int h) {
h ^= (h &gt;&gt;&gt; 20) ^ (h &gt;&gt;&gt; 12);
return h ^ (h &gt;&gt;&gt; 7) ^ (h &gt;&gt;&gt; 4);
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-java">// JAVA 8: the &quot;rehash&quot; function
static final int hash(Object key) {
int h;
return (key == null) ? 0 : (h = key.hashCode()) ^ (h &gt;&gt;&gt; 16);
}
// the function that returns the index from the rehashed hash
static int indexFor(int h, int length) {
return h &amp; (length-1);
}
</code></pre>
<p>In order to work efficiently, the size of the inner array needs to be a power of <code>2</code>, let&#x2019;s see why.</p>
<p>Imagine the array size is <code>17</code>, the mask value is going to be <code>16 (size -1)</code>. The binary representation of <code>16</code> is <code>0&#x2026;010000</code>, so for any hash value H the index generated with the bitwise formula &#x201C;<code>H AND 16</code>&#x201D; is going to be either <code>16</code> or <code>0</code>. This means that the array of size <code>17</code> will only be used for 2 buckets: the one at index 0 and the one at index 16, not very efficient&#x2026;</p>
<p>But, if you now take a size that is a power of 2 like 16, the bitwise index formula is &#x201C;H AND 15&#x201D;. The binary representation of 15 is 0&#x2026;001111 so the index formula can output values from 0 to 15 and the array of size 16 is fully used. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>if H = 952 , its binary representation is 0..01110111000, the associated index is 0&#x2026;01000 = 8</code></li>
<li><code>if H = 1576 its binary representation is 0..011000101000, the associated index is 0&#x2026;01000 = 8</code></li>
<li><code>if H = 12356146, its binary representation is 0..0101111001000101000110010, the associated index is 0&#x2026;00010 = 2</code></li>
<li><code>if H = 59843, its binary representation is 0..01110100111000011, the associated index is 0&#x2026;00011 = 3</code>
This is why the array size is a power of two. This mechanism is transparent for the developer: if he chooses a HashMap with a size of 37, the Map will automatically choose the next power of 2 after 37 (64) for the size of its inner array.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-auto-resizing">2. Auto resizing</h3>
<p>After getting the index, the function (<code>get, put or remove</code>) visits/iterates the associated linked list to see if there is an existing Entry for the given key. Without modification, this mechanism could lead to performance issues because the function needs to iterate through the entire list to see if the entry exists. Imagine that the size of the inner array is the default value (16) and you need to store 2 millions values. In the best case scenario, each linked list will have a size of <code>125 000</code> entries (2/16 millions). So, each <code>get(), remove() and put()</code> will lead to <code>125 000</code> iterations/operations. To avoid this case, the HashMap has the ability to increase its inner array in order to keep very short linked lists.</p>
<p>When you create a HashMap, you can specify an initial size and a loadFactor with the following constructor:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-java">public HashMap(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor)
</code></pre>
<p>If you don&#x2019;t specify arguments, the default <code>initialCapacity</code> is <code>16</code> and the default <code>loadFactor</code> is <code>0.75</code>. The <code>initialCapacity</code> represents to the size of the inner array of linked lists.</p>
<p>Each time you add a new key/value in your Map with put(&#x2026;), the function checks if it needs to increase the capacity of the inner array. In order to do that, the map stores 2 data:</p>
<ul>
<li>The size of the map: it represents the number of entries in the HashMap. This value is updated each time an Entry is added or removed.</li>
<li>A threshold: it&#x2019;s equal to (capacity of the inner array) <code>* loadFactor</code> and it is refreshed after each resize of the inner array</li>
</ul>
<p>Before adding the new Entry, put(&#x2026;) checks if <code>size &gt; threshold</code> and if it the case it recreates a new array with a doubled size. Since the size of the new array has changed, the indexing function (which returns the bitwise operation &#x201C;<code>hash(key) AND (sizeOfArray-1)</code>&#x201D;) changes. So, the resizing of the array creates twice more buckets (i.e. linked lists) and redistributes all the existing entries into the buckets (the old ones and the newly created).</p>
<p>This aim of this resize operation is to decrease the size of the linked lists so that the time cost of <code>put(), remove() and get()</code> methods stays low. All entries whose keys have the same hash will stay in the same bucket after the resizing. But, 2 entries with different hash keys that were in the same bucket before might not be in the same bucket after the transformation.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: the HashMap only increases the size of the inner array, it doesn&#x2019;t provide a way to decrease it.</p>
<h3 id="3-thread-safety">3. Thread Safety</h3>
<p>If you already know HashMaps, you know that is not threads safe, but why? For example imagine that you have a Writer thread that puts only new data into the Map and a Reader thread that reads data from the Map, why shouldn&#x2019;t it work?</p>
<p>Because during the auto-resizing mechanism, if a thread tries to put or get an object, the map might use the old index value and won&#x2019;t find the new bucket in which the entry is.</p>
<p>The worst case scenario is when 2 threads put a data at the same time and the 2 put() calls resize the Map at the same time. Since both threads modify the linked lists at the same time, the Map might end up with an inner-loop in one of its linked lists. If you tries to get a data in the list with an inner loop, the get() will never end.</p>
<p>The HashTable implementation is a thread safe implementation that prevents from this situation. But, since all the CRUD methods are synchronized this implementation is very slow. For example, if thread 1 calls get(key1), thread 2 calls get(key2) and thread 3 calls get(key3), only one thread at a time will be able to get its value whereas the 3 of them could access the data at the same time.</p>
<p>A smarter implementation of a thread safe HashMap exists since JAVA 5: the <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code>. <strong>Only the buckets are synchronized</strong> so multiples threads can <code>get(), remove() or put()</code> data at the same time if it doesn&#x2019;t imply accessing the same bucket or resizing the inner array. It&#x2019;s better to use this implementation in a multithreaded application.</p>
<h3 id="4-key-immutability">4. Key immutability</h3>
<p>Why <code>String</code> and <code>Integer</code> are a good implementation of keys for HashMap? Mostly because they are immutable! If you choose to create your own Key class and don&#x2019;t make it immutable, you might lose data inside the HashMap.</p>
<p>Look at the following use case:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have a key that has an inner value &#x201C;1&#x201D;</li>
<li>You put an object in the HashMap with this key</li>
<li>The HashMap generates a hash from the hashcode of the Key (so from &#x201C;1&#x201D;)</li>
<li>The Map stores this hash in the newly created Entry</li>
<li>You modify the inner value of the key to &#x201C;2&#x201D;</li>
<li>The hash value of the key is modified but the HashMap doesn&#x2019;t know it (because the old hash value is stored)</li>
<li>You try to get your object with your modified key</li>
<li>The map computes the new hash of your key (so from &#x201C;2&#x201D;) to find in which linked list (bucket) the entry is</li>
<li>Case 1: Since you modified your key, the map tries to find the entry in the wrong bucket and doesn&#x2019;t find it</li>
<li>case 2: Luckily, the modified key generates the same bucket as the old key. The map then iterates through the linked list to find the entry with the same key. But to find the key, the map first compares the hash values and then calls the equals() comparison. Since your modified key doesn&#x2019;t have the same hash as the old hash value (stored in the entry), the map won&#x2019;t find the entry in the linked-list.
Here is a concrete example in Java. I put 2 key-value pairs in my Map, I modify the first key and then try to get the 2 values. Only the second value is returned from the map, the first value is &#x201C;lost&#x201D; in the HashMap:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="lang-java">public class MutableKeyTest {
public static void main(String[] args) {
class MyKey {
Integer i;
public void setI(Integer i) { this.i = i; }
public MyKey(Integer i) { this.i = i;}

@Override
public int hashCode() {return i;}
@Override
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
if (obj instanceof MyKey) {
return i.equals(((MyKey) obj).i);
} else
return false;
}
}

Map&lt;MyKey, String&gt; myMap = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
MyKey key1 = new MyKey(1);
MyKey key2 = new MyKey(2);
myMap.put(key1, &quot;test &quot; + 1);
myMap.put(key2, &quot;test &quot; + 2);

// modifying key1
key1.setI(3);

String test1 = myMap.get(key1);
String test2 = myMap.get(key2);

System.out.println(&quot;test1= &quot; + test1 + &quot; test2=&quot; + test2);
}
}
</code></pre>
<p>The output is: &#x201C;<code>test1= null test2=test 2</code>&#x201D;. As expected, the Map wasn&#x2019;t able to retrieve the string 1 with the modified key 1.</p>
<h3 id="5-java-8-improvements">5. JAVA 8 improvements</h3>
<p>The inner representation of the HashMap has changed a lot in JAVA 8. Indeed, the implementation in JAVA 7 takes 1k lines of code whereas the implementation in JAVA 8 takes 2k lines. Most of what I&#x2019;ve said previously is true except the linked lists of entries. In JAVA8, you still have an array but it now stores Nodes that contains the exact same information as Entries and therefore are also linked lists:</p>
<p>Here is a part of the Node implementation in JAVA 8:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-java">static class Node&lt;K,V&gt; implements Map.Entry&lt;K,V&gt; {
final int hash;
final K key;
V value;
Node&lt;K,V&gt; next;
...
}
</code></pre>
<p>So what&#x2019;s the big difference with JAVA 7? Well, Nodes can be extended to TreeNodes. A TreeNode is a red-black tree structure that stores really more information so that it can add, delete or get an element in <code>O(log(n))</code>.</p>
<p>FYI, here is the exhaustive list of the data stored inside a TreeNode</p>
<pre><code class="lang-java">static final class TreeNode&lt;K,V&gt; extends LinkedHashMap.Entry&lt;K,V&gt; {
final int hash; // inherited from Node&lt;K,V&gt;
final K key; // inherited from Node&lt;K,V&gt;
V value; // inherited from Node&lt;K,V&gt;
Node&lt;K,V&gt; next; // inherited from Node&lt;K,V&gt;
Entry&lt;K,V&gt; before, after;// inherited from LinkedHashMap.Entry&lt;K,V&gt;
TreeNode&lt;K,V&gt; parent;
TreeNode&lt;K,V&gt; left;
TreeNode&lt;K,V&gt; right;
TreeNode&lt;K,V&gt; prev;
boolean red;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Red black trees are self-balancing binary search trees. Their inner mechanisms ensure that their length is always in <code>log(n)</code> despite new adds or removes of nodes. <strong>The main advantage</strong> to use those trees is in a case where many data are in the same index (bucket) of the inner table, the search in a tree will cost <code>O(log(n))</code> whereas it would have cost O(n) with a linked list.</p>
<p>As you see, the tree takes really more space than the linked list (we&#x2019;ll speak about it in the next part).</p>
<p>By inheritance, the inner table can contain both Node (linked list ) and TreeNode (red-black tree). Oracle decided to use both data structures with the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>If for a given index (bucket) in the inner table there are more than 8 nodes, the linked list is transformed into a red black tree</li>
<li>If for a given index (bucket) in the inner table there are less than 6 nodes, the tree is transformed into a linked list
<img src="../../assets/hashmap-tree.jpg" alt="">
This picture shows an inner array of a JAVA 8 HashMap with both trees (at bucket 0) and linked lists (at bucket 1,2 and 3). Bucket 0 is a Tree because it has more than 8 nodes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-memory-overhead">6. Memory overhead</h3>
<h5 id="61-java-7">6.1 JAVA 7</h5>
<p>The use of a HashMap comes at a cost in terms of memory. In JAVA 7, a HashMap wraps key-value pairs in Entries. An entry has:</p>
<ul>
<li>a reference to a next entry</li>
<li>a precomputed hash (integer)</li>
<li>a reference to the key</li>
<li>a reference to the value</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, a JAVA 7 HashMap uses an inner array of Entry. Assuming a JAVA 7 HashMap contains N elements and its inner array has a capacity CAPACITY, the extra memory cost is approximately:
<code>sizeOf(integer)* N + sizeOf(reference)* (3*N+C)</code></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>the size of an integer depends equals <code>4</code> bytes</li>
<li>the size of a reference depends on the JVM/OS/Processor but is often <code>4</code> bytes.
Which means that the overhead is often <code>16 * N + 4 * CAPACITY</code> bytes</li>
</ul>
<p>Reminder: after an auto-resizing of the Map, the CAPACITY of the inner array equals the next power of two after N.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Since JAVA 7, the HashMap class has a <strong>lazy init</strong>. That means that even if you allocate a HashMap, the inner array of entry (that costs 4 * CAPACITY bytes) won&#x2019;t be allocated in memory until the first use of the put() method.</p>
<h5 id="62-java-8">6.2 JAVA 8</h5>
<p>With the JAVA 8 implementation, it becomes a little bit complicated to get the memory usage because a Node can contain the same data as an Entry or the same data plus 6 references and a Boolean (if it&#x2019;s a TreeNode).</p>
<p>If the all the nodes are only Nodes, the memory consumption of the JAVA 8 HashMap is the same as the JAVA 7 HashMap.</p>
<p>If the all the nodes are TreeNodes, the memory consumption of a JAVA 8 HashMap becomes:
<code>N * sizeOf(integer) + N * sizeOf(boolean) + sizeOf(reference)* (9*N+CAPACITY )</code></p>
<p>In most standards JVM, it&#x2019;s equal to <code>44 * N + 4 * CAPACITY</code> bytes</p>
<h3 id="7-performance-issues">7. Performance issues</h3>
<h5 id="71-skewed-hashmap-vs-well-balanced-hashmap">7.1 Skewed HashMap vs well balanced HashMap:</h5>
<p>In the best case scenario, the <code>get()</code> and <code>put()</code> methods have a <code>O(1)</code> cost in time complexity. But, if you don&#x2019;t take care of the hash function of the key, you might end up with very slow <code>put()</code> and <code>get()</code> calls. The good performance of the put() and get depends on the repartition of the data into the different indexes of the inner array (the buckets). If the hash function of your key is ill-designed, you&#x2019;ll have a skew repartition (no matter how big the capacity of the inner array is). All the put() and get() that use the biggest linked lists of entry will be slow because they&#x2019;ll need to iterate the entire lists.</p>
<p>In the worst case scenario (if most of the data are in the same buckets), you could end up with a <code>O(n)</code> time complexity.</p>
<h5 id="72-resizing-overhead">7.2 Resizing overhead</h5>
<p>If you need to store a lot of data, you should create your HashMap with an initial capacity close to your expected volume.</p>
<p>If you don&#x2019;t do that, the Map will take the default size of <code>16</code> with a <code>factorLoad</code> of <code>0.75</code>. The <code>11</code> first put() will be very fast but the <code>12th (16*0.75)</code> will recreate a new inner array (with its associated linked lists/trees) with a new capacity of <code>32</code>. The <code>13th</code> to <code>23th</code> will be fast but the <code>24th (32*0.75)</code> will recreate (again) a costly new representation that doubles the size of the inner array. The internal resizing operation will appear at the <code>48th, 96th,192th</code>, &#x2026; call of put(). At low volume the full recreation of the inner array is fast but at high volume it can takes seconds to minutes. By initially setting your expected size, you can avoid these costly operations.</p>
<p>But there is a drawback: if you set a very high array size like <code>2^28</code> whereas you&#x2019;re only using <code>2^26</code> buckets in your array, you will waste a lot of memory (approximately <code>2^30</code> bytes in this case).</p>
