Class and Object\n\nClass is a blueprint which describes a category of objects.\nObject is instance which is concrete.\n\n1.1 Access modifier\nFour types: private / default / protected / public\n\nprivate: is only accessible inside the class.\ndefault: is accessible inside the package.\nprotected: is accessible inside the package and sub-classes outside the package.\npublic, is accessible everywhere.\n\nFor class, only two modifiers public or default.\n1.2 Constructor\npublic People(){}\n\nIt has the same name as Class.\nNo return type (You cannot put any return type, even for void)\nIf you don't explicitly define any constructor, system will provide a default one (empty args). Otherwise, system will not provide any constructor. Note, when spring IOC injects an object, it requires object has an explicit empty constructor.\nIf you do not want the class to be constructed outside, use private private People(){}\n\n2. Encapsulation (hiding data)\nEncapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts:\n\nEncapsulation: hiding data. Often referred to as \"Information Hiding\", revolves more specifically around internal data (fields / members representing the state) owned by a class instance, by enforcing access to the internal data in a controlled manner, and preventing direct, external change to these fields.\nAbstraction: occurs during class level design, with the objective of hiding the implementation complexity of how the the features offered by an API / design / system were implemented, in a sense simplifying the 'interface' to access the underlying implementation.\nInheritance: refers to using the structure and behavior of a superclass in a subclass.\nPolymorphism: refers to changing the behavior of a superclass in the subclass.\n\nEncapsulation is the technique of making the fields in a class private and providing access to the fields via public methods. If a field is declared private, it cannot be accessed by anyone outside the class, thereby hiding the fields within the class. For this reason, encapsulation is also referred to as data hiding.\nEncapsulation can be described as a protective barrier that prevents the code and data being randomly accessed by other code defined outside the class. Access to the data and code is tightly controlled by an interface.\nThe main benefit of encapsulation is the ability to modify our implemented code without breaking the code of others who use our code. With this feature Encapsulation gives maintainability, flexibility and extensibility to our code.\npublic class EncapTest{\nprivate String name;\nprivate String idNum;\nprivate int age;\n\npublic int getAge(){\nreturn age;\n}\npublic String getName(){\nreturn name;\n}\npublic String getIdNum(){\nreturn idNum;\n}\n\n//With setter(), you can put some defence conditions here. Otherwise, you lost the control\npublic void setAge( int newAge){\nif (newAge \n3. Abstraction\n3.1 Abstract Class\n\nAn abstract class is a class that is declared abstract —it may or may not include abstract methods.\nAbstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed.\n\n3.2 Abstract Method\n\nAn abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation.public boolean validateDate(String date);\n\n\nWhen an abstract class is subclassed, the subclass usually provides implementations for all of the abstract methods in its parent class. However, if it does not, then the subclass must also be declared abstract.\n\nNote: Methods in an interface (see the Interfaces section) that are not declared as default or static are implicitly abstract, so the abstract modifier is not used with interface methods. (It can be used, but it is unnecessary.)\n3.3 static members\nAn abstract class may have static fields and static methods. You can use these static members with a class reference (for example, AbstractClass.staticMethod()) as you would with any other class.\n3.4 Abstract Classes VS Interfaces\n\n\n\nAbstract Classes\nInterfaces\n\n\n\n\nNo restriction on fields\nAll fields are public static final\n\n\nNo restriction on methods\nAll methods are public\n\n\nOnly extends one class\nCan extend multiple interfaces\n\n\nCannot be instantiated\nCannot be instantiated\n\n\n\n\nConsider using abstract classes if any of these statements apply to your situation:\n\nYou want to share code among several closely related classes.\nYou expect that classes that extend your abstract class have many common methods or fields, or require access modifiers other than public (such as protected and private).\nYou want to declare non-static or non-final fields. This enables you to define methods that can access and modify the state of the object to which they belong.\n\n\nConsider using interfaces if any of these statements apply to your situation:\n\nYou expect that unrelated classes would implement your interface. For example, the interfaces Comparable and Cloneable are implemented by many unrelated classes.\nYou want to specify the behavior of a particular data type, but not concerned about who implements its behavior.\nYou want to take advantage of multiple inheritance of type.\n\n\n\n4. Inheritance\n4.1 Subclass and Superclass\n\nA class that is derived from another class is called a subclass (also a derived class, extended class, or child class).\nThe class from which the subclass is derived is called a superclass (also a base class or a parent class).\nA subclass inherits all the members (fields, methods, and nested classes) from its superclass. Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by subclasses, but the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass by super().\n\nWhat you can do in a subclass\n\nThe inherited fields can be used directly, just like any other fields.\nYou can declare a field in the subclass with the same name as the one in the superclass, thus hiding it (not recommended).\nYou can declare new fields in the subclass that are not in the superclass.\nThe inherited methods can be used directly as they are.\nYou can write a new instance method in the subclass that has the same signature as the one in the superclass, thus overriding it. If you still want to use the method implementation in superclass, you can use super to invoke it, like super.methodA().\nYou can write a new static method in the subclass that has the same signature as the one in the superclass, thus hiding it.\nYou can declare new methods in the subclass that are not in the superclass.\nYou can write a subclass constructor that invokes the constructor of the superclass, either implicitly or by using the keyword super.\n\n4.2 Private members in Superclass\n\nA subclass does not inherit the private members of its parent class. However, if the superclass has public or protected methods for accessing its private fields, these can also be used by the subclass.\n\nA nested class has access to all the private members of its enclosing class—both fields and methods. Therefore, a public or protected nested class inherited by a subclass has indirect access to all of the private members of the superclass.\n\n\n4.3 Overriding and Hiding Methods\n\nAn instance method in a subclass with the same signature and return type as an instance method in the superclass overrides the superclass's method.\nIf a subclass defines a static method with the same signature as a static method in the superclass, then the method in the subclass hides the one in the superclass.\n\nRule 1: instance field and static member are invoked based on declared type.\n\nRule 2: instance method is invoked based on assigned type.\n\nRule 3: subclass cannot define a more restricted access modifier on an override method than superclass's method.\n\n\nExample:\npublic class Animal {\nprivate int i = 10;\npublic int j = 20;\npublic static int z = 30;\n\npublic static void testStatic() {\nSystem.out.println(\"calling super static method\");\n}\npublic void testInstanceMethod() {\nSystem.out.println(\"calling super instance method\");\n}\npublic void testAccess() {}\n}\n\npublic class Cat extends Animal {\n\npublic int j = 50;\npublic static int z = 60;\n\npublic static void testStatic() {\nSystem.out.println(\"calling sub static method\");\n}\npublic void testInstanceMethod() {\nSystem.out.println(\"calling sub instance method\");\n}\n// Rule 3: error\nprotected void testAccess(){}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\nAnimal animal = new Animal();\nCat cat = new Cat();\nAnimal animalCat = cat;\n\nSystem.out.println(animalCat.j); // Rule 1: call super.j 20\nSystem.out.println(animalCat.z); // Rule 1: call super.z 30\nanimalCat.testInstanceMethod(); // Rule 2: call sub.testInstanceMethod()\nanimalCat.testStatic(); // Rule 1: call super.testStatic()\n}\n}\n4.4 Hiding fields\nWithin a class, a field that has the same name as a field in the superclass hides the superclass's field, even if their types are different. Within the subclass, the field in the superclass cannot be referenced by its simple name. Instead, the field must be accessed through super, which is covered in the next section. Generally speaking, we don't recommend hiding fields as it makes code difficult to read.\n4.5 Keyword: super\n\nAccessing Superclass Members\nIf your method overrides one of its superclass's methods, you can invoke the overridden method through the use of the keyword super. You can also use super to refer to a hidden field (although hiding fields is discouraged).\n\nSubclasses Constructors\n\n\nExample:\npublic MountainBike(int startHeight,\nint startCadence,\nint startSpeed,\nint startGear) {\nsuper(startCadence, startSpeed, startGear);\nseatHeight = startHeight;\n}\nRule: Invocation of a superclass constructor must be the first line in the subclass constructor.\n4.6 Object as a Superclass\nThe Object class, in the java.lang package, sits at the top of the class hierarchy tree. Every class is a descendant, direct or indirect, of the Object class.\n\nprotected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException\nCreates and returns a copy of this object.\npublic boolean equals(Object obj)\nIndicates whether some other object is \"equal to\" this one.\nprotected void finalize() throws Throwable\nCalled by the garbage collector on an object when garbage\ncollection determines that there are no more references to the object\npublic final Class getClass()\nReturns the runtime class of an object.\npublic int hashCode()\nReturns a hash code value for the object.\npublic String toString()\nReturns a string representation of the object.\n\nThe following methods all play a part in synchronizing the activities of independently running threads in a program:\n\npublic final void notify()\npublic final void notifyAll()\npublic final void wait()\npublic final void wait(long timeout)\npublic final void wait(long timeout, int nanos)\n\n4.6.1 hashCode() Method\nThe value returned by hashCode() is the object's hash code, which is the object's memory address in hexadecimal.\nBy definition, if two objects are equal, their hash code must also be equal. If you override the equals() method, you change the way two objects are equated and Object's implementation of hashCode() is no longer valid. Therefore, if you override the equals() method, you must also override the hashCode() method as well.\n4.6.2 equals() Method\nThe equals() method compares two objects for equality and returns true if they are equal. For two objects, if you do not override equals() and hashCode() , they will never be equal. Because super equals() compares the hashCode which is the memory address of object.\n4.6.3 finalize() Method\nThe Object class provides a callback method, finalize(), that may be invoked on an object when it becomes garbage. Object's implementation of finalize() does nothing—you can override finalize() to do cleanup, such as freeing resources.\nThe finalize() method may be called automatically by the system, but when it is called, or even if it is called, is uncertain. Therefore, you should not rely on this method to do your cleanup for you. For example, if you don't close file descriptors in your code after performing I/O and you expect finalize() to close them for you, you may run out of file descriptors.\n5. Polymorphism\n5.1 Definition:\nPolymprphism means many forms. Subclasses of a class can define their own unique behaviors and yet share some of the same functionality of the parent class.\nExample:\npublic abstract class Human{\npublic abstract void goPee();\n}\npublic class Male extends Human{\n@Override\npublic void goPee(){\nSystem.out.println(\"Stand Up\");\n}\n}\npublic class Female extends Human{\n@Override\npublic void goPee(){\nSystem.out.println(\"Sit Down\");\n}\n}\npublic static void main(String[] args){\nArrayList group = new ArrayList();\ngroup.add(new Male());\ngroup.add(new Female());\n// ... add more...\n\n// tell the class to take a pee break\nfor (Human person : group){ person.goPee(); }\n}\n\n//Running this would yield:\nStand Up\nSit Down\n5.2 Compile time polymorphism (static binding or method overloading)\nMethod overloading, an object can have two or more methods with same name, BUT, with their method parameters different. If only return type is different for two methods, this is not allowed.\n// Difference in parameter type\npublic static double Math.max(double a, double b){..}\npublic static float Math.max(float a, float b){..}\npublic static int Math.max(int a, int b){..}\npublic static long Math.max(long a, long b){..}\n\n// Difference in parameter count\nEmployeeFactory.create(String firstName, String lastName){...}\nEmployeeFactory.create(Integer id, String firstName, String lastName){...}\n\n//The following case is NOT allowed\npublic int test(int i) { return i;}\npublic void test(int i) { system.out.println(i)}\n5.3 Runtime polymorphism (dynamic binding or method overriding)\nRuntime polymorphism is essentially referred as method overriding. Method overriding is a feature which you get when you implement inheritance in your program.\n* Rule: Always invoked assigned object's instance method.\n6. Interface\n6.1 Definition:\nThere are a number of situations in software engineering when it is important for disparate groups of programmers to agree to a \"contract\" that spells out how their software interacts. Each group should be able to write their code without any knowledge of how the other group's code is written. Generally speaking, interfaces are such contracts.\n\nInterface can contain only\nfields are constants (public static final)\nmethods are public abstract, never final\ndefault methods(have method body) // in Java 8\nstatic methods (have method body) // in Java 8\nnested types\nInterfaces cannot be instantiated—they can only be implemented by classes or extended by other interfaces.\n\n6.2 Default Methods (Java 8)\nDefault methods enable you to add new functionality to the interfaces of your libraries and ensure binary compatibility with code written for older versions of those interfaces.\n6.3 Static Methods (Java 8)\nYou can define static methods in interfaces. (A static method is a method that is associated with the class in which it is defined rather than with any object. Every instance of the class shares its static methods.) This makes it easier for you to organize helper methods in your libraries; you can keep static methods specific to an interface in the same interface rather than in a separate class.\n6.4 Implementation\n\nDefining an interface\n\npublic interface TimeClient {\n//(public static final)\ndouble E = 2.718282;\n//abstract method: (public abstract)\nvoid doSomething (int i, double x);\nvoid setTime(int hour, int minute, int second);\nvoid setDate(int day, int month, int year);\nvoid setDateAndTime(int day, int month, int year,\nint hour, int minute, int second);\nLocalDateTime getLocalDateTime();\n// static method (public): only in Java 8\nstatic ZoneId getZoneId (String zoneString) {\ntry {\nreturn ZoneId.of(zoneString);\n} catch (DateTimeException e) {\nSystem.err.println(\"Invalid time zone: \" + zoneString +\n\"; using default time zone instead.\");\nreturn ZoneId.systemDefault();\n}\n}\n// default method (public): only in Java 8\ndefault ZonedDateTime getZonedDateTime(String zoneString) {\nreturn ZonedDateTime.of(getLocalDateTime(), getZoneId(zoneString));\n}\n}\n\nImplementing an interface\npublic class TestSimpleTimeClient {\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\nTimeClient myTimeClient = new SimpleTimeClient();\nSystem.out.println(\"Current time: \" + myTimeClient.toString());\nSystem.out.println(\"Time in California: \" +\nmyTimeClient.getZonedDateTime(\"Blah blah\").toString());\n}\n}\n\nUsing an Interface as a Type\nIf you define a reference variable whose type is an interface, any object you assign to it must be an instance of a class that implements the interface.\n\n\n7. Static, Final, and Nested Classes\n7.1 Static\n7.1.1 Static Method\n\nYou can only access class's static fields or methods, non-static fields and methods are in-accessible.\nthis / super cannot be used in static method,because you don't need an instance to access static method.\n\n7.1.2 Static Block\nWhen a class is loaded, its static block will be executed (only once) before main method. Static block is usually used for class's initialization.\nExample 1: Singleton\nclass Source {\nprivate static Connection conn = new Connection();\nprivate Source() {}\npublic static Connection getConnection() {\nreturn conn;\n}\n}\nExample 2: main method\n// 1) JVM needs to invoke main mehtod, so the access modifier must be public.\n// 2) JVM does not create an instace for the class, so it must be a static method.\n// 3) argument is a String array.\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n}\n7.2 Final\nfinal can be used on variable, method, and class\n\nOn variable: final fields or local variables are constants, can only be assigned once. And final variables must have assigned value when they are declared or be assigned in constructor explicitly.\nOn method: indicate that the method cannot be overridden by subclasses. The Object class does this—a number of its methods are final.\nOn class: indicate that the class cannot be subclassed. This is particularly useful, for example, when creating an immutable class like the String class. Example: The wrapper classes for the primitive types:java.lang.Integer ,java.lang.Byte ,java.lang.Character ,java.lang.Short ,java.lang.Boolean ,java.lang.Long ,java.lang.Double ,java.lang.Float\n\nYou might wish to make a method final if it has an implementation that should not be changed and it is critical to the consistent state of the object. For example, you might want to make the getFirstPlayer method in this ChessAlgorithm class final:\nclass ChessAlgorithm {\nenum ChessPlayer { WHITE, BLACK }\nfinal ChessPlayer getFirstPlayer() { return ChessPlayer.WHITE; }\n}\nMethods called from constructors should generally be declared final. If a constructor calls a non-final method, a subclass may redefine that method with surprising or undesirable results.\n7.3 Nested Classes (one implementation of encapsulation)\n7.3.1 Definition: A nested class is a class which is defined within another class.\n\nNestes classes\nstatic nested classes\nnon-static nested classes (inner classes)\nlocal classes\nanonymous classes\nNon-static nested classes (inner classes) have access to other members of the enclosing class, even if they are declared private.\nIts name must be different from the class's name.\nIts members cannot be declared as static.\n\nStatic nested classes do not have access to other members of the enclosing class.\n\nIt can use them only through an object reference.\n\nAs a member of the OuterClass, a nested class can be declared private, public, protected, or package private.

For example, you would use a lambda expression if you want a certain action performed on each element of a collection, when a process is completed, or when a process encounters an error. Use it if you need a simple instance of a functional interface and none of the preceding criteria apply (for example, you do not need a constructor, a named type, fields, or additional methods).\n\nNested class: Use it if your requirements are similar to those of a local class, you want to make the type more widely available, and you don't require access to local variables or method parameters.\n\nUse a non-static nested class (or inner class) if you require access to an enclosing instance's all fields and methods.\n\nUse a static nested class if you don't require this access.\n\n\n"},"java-quick-review/chapter03_exception.html":{"url":"java-quick-review/chapter03_exception.html","title":"Exception","keywords":"","body":"#\nChapter III: Exception\n1.1 Exception\nAn exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. Two categories:\n\nChecked Exception(compile time exception): Applications are expected to be able to catch and meaningfully do something with the rest, such as FileNotFoundException and TimeoutException. Compiler forces client handle this exception ( either catch the exception or declare it in a throws clause.)\n\nUnchecked Exception:\n\nRuntimeException: Runtime exceptions are those exceptions that are thrown at runtime because of either wrong input data or because of wrong business logic etc. These are not checked by the compiler at compile time.\n\nError: It is mostly thrown by JVM which is fatal and there is no way for the application to recover from that error. For instance: OutOfMemoryError. Errors should not be caught or handled.\n\n\n1.2 Exception Examples\n\nIOException (checked)\nFileNotFoundException\nEOFException\nFileSystemException\n\nRuntimeException (unchecked)\n\nNullPointerException\nIndexOutOfBoundsException\nArithmeticException\n\n1.3 Handle Exception\nTwo ways:\n\ntry / catch / finally\nthrows\n\n1.3.1 try / catch / finally\n\nYou may have one try, one finally, and multiple catches. Note: exception2 must be exception1's superclass.\nfinally block always be executed even try have a return clause.\nFor an overridded method in subclass, its defined catch exception must be same or a derived exception to the exception in superclass.\nIf the exception from try block is caught by catch block, it looks like catch block eats the exception and continue to run the rest of code. If not, the app will be interrupted and stopped. The rest of code won't be executed.\nThe finally block may not execute if\nSystem.exit() is called. So the JVM exits while the try or catch code is being executed.\nJVM crashes. Likewise, if the thread executing the try or catch code is interrupted or killed, the finally block may not execute even though the application as a whole continues.\nThe try{} block never ends.try {}\ncatch(e1){}\ncatch(e2){}\n.\n.\ncatch(en){}\nfinally{}\n\n\n1.3.2 Throws\npublic class A {\npublic void methodA() throws IOException {}\n}\n\npublic class B1 extends A {\npublic void methodA() throws FileNotFoundException {} // this exception has to be IOException or its subclasses\n}\n\npublic class B2 extends A {\npublic void methodA() throws Exception { //error, because Exception is the superclass of IOException}\n}\n1.4 Customize Exception\nclass MyException extends Exception {\nprivate int idnumber;\npublic MyException(String message, int id) {\nsuper(message);\nthis.idnumber = id;\n}\npublic int getId() {\nreturn idnumber;\n}\n}\n\n\npublic class Test{\npublic void regist(int num) throws MyException {\nif (num 2. The try-with-resources statement\nThe try-with-resources statement is a try statement that declares one or more resources. A resource is an object that must be closed after the program is finished with it. The try-with-resources statement ensures that each resource is closed at the end of the statement. Any object that implements java.lang.AutoCloseable, which includes all objects which implement java.io.Closeable, can be used as a resource.\n2.1 Example\nReads the first line from a file. It uses an instance of BufferedReader to read data from the file. BufferedReader is a resource that must be closed after the program is finished with it:\n// example 1:\nstatic String readFirstLineFromFile(String path) throws IOException {\ntry (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(path))) {\nreturn br.readLine();\n}\n}\n\n// example 2:\npublic static void viewTable(Connection con) throws SQLException {\nString query = \"select COF_NAME, SUP_ID, PRICE, SALES, TOTAL from COFFEES\";\n\ntry (Statement stmt = con.createStatement()) {\nResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query);\n\nwhile (rs.next()) {\nString coffeeName = rs.getString(\"COF_NAME\");\nint supplierID = rs.getInt(\"SUP_ID\");\nfloat price = rs.getFloat(\"PRICE\");\nint sales = rs.getInt(\"SALES\");\nint total = rs.getInt(\"TOTAL\");\n}\n} catch (SQLException e) {\nJDBCTutorialUtilities.printSQLException(e);\n}\n}\n\nThe class BufferedReader, in Java SE 7 and later, implements the interface java.lang.AutoCloseable. Because the BufferedReader instance is declared in a try-with-resource statement, it will be closed regardless of whether the try statement completes normally or abruptly.\n2.2 try-with-resources VS finally{}\nYou can use a finally block to ensure that a resource is closed regardless of whether the try statement completes normally or abruptly.\nstatic String readFirstLineFromFileWithFinallyBlock(String path) throws IOException {\nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(path));\ntry {\nreturn br.readLine(); // suppressed\n} finally {\nif (br != null) br.close(); // throws exception\n}\n}\n\nIn this example, if the methods readLine() and close() both throw exceptions, then the method readFirstLineFromFileWithFinallyBlock() throws the exception thrown from the finally block; the exception thrown from the try block is suppressed.\nIn contrast, in the example readFirstLineFromFile(), if exceptions are thrown from both the try block and the try-with-resources statement, then the method readFirstLineFromFile throws the exception thrown from the try block; the exception thrown from the try-with-resources block is suppressed.\n2.3 Multi try-with-resources\nYou may declare one or more resources in a try-with-resources statement.\npublic static void writeToFileZipFileContents(String zipFileName,String outputFileName) throws java.io.IOException {\n\njava.nio.charset.Charset charset = java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets.US_ASCII;\njava.nio.file.Path outputFilePath = java.nio.file.Paths.get(outputFileName);\n\n// Open zip file and create output file with\n// try-with-resources statement\n\ntry (\njava.util.zip.ZipFile zf = new java.util.zip.ZipFile(zipFileName);\njava.io.BufferedWriter writer = java.nio.file.Files.newBufferedWriter(outputFilePath, charset)\n) {\n// Enumerate each entry\nfor (java.util.Enumeration entries = zf.entries(); entries.hasMoreElements();) {\n// Get the entry name and write it to the output file\nString newLine = System.getProperty(\"line.separator\");\nString zipEntryName = ((java.util.zip.ZipEntry)entries.nextElement()).getName() + newLine;\nwriter.write(zipEntryName, 0, zipEntryName.length());\n}\n}\n}\n\nWhen the block of code that directly follows it terminates, either normally or because of an exception, the close methods of the BufferedWriter and ZipFile objects are automatically called in this order. Note that the close methods of resources are called in the opposite order of their creation.\nNote: A try-with-resources statement can have catch and finally blocks just like an ordinary try statement. In a try-with-resources statement, any catch or finally block is run after the resources declared have been closed.\n2.4 Suppressed Exceptions\nAn exception can be thrown from the block of code associated with the try-with-resources statement. In the example writeToFileZipFileContents, an exception can be thrown from the try block, and up to two exceptions can be thrown from the try-with-resources statement when it tries to close the ZipFile and BufferedWriter objects. If an exception is thrown from the try block and one or more exceptions are thrown from the try-with-resources statement, then those exceptions thrown from the try-with-resources statement are suppressed, and the exception thrown by the block is the one that is thrown by the writeToFileZipFileContents method. You can retrieve these suppressed exceptions by calling the Throwable.getSuppressed method from the exception thrown by the try block.\n2.5 Classes That Implement the AutoCloseable or Closeable Interface\nSee the Javadoc of the AutoCloseable and Closeable interfaces for a list of classes that implement either of these interfaces. The Closeable interface extends the AutoCloseable interface. The close method of the Closeable interface throws exceptions of type IOException while the close method of the AutoCloseable interface throws exceptions of type Exception. Consequently, subclasses of the AutoCloseable interface can override this behavior of the close method to throw specialized exceptions, such as IOException, or no exception at all.\n3 Advantages of Exceptions\n3.1 Advantage 1: Separating Error-Handling Code from \"Regular\" Code\nExceptions provide the means to separate the details of what to do when something out of the ordinary happens from the main logic of a program. In traditional programming, error detection, reporting, and handling often lead to confusing spaghetti code. For example, consider the pseudocode method here that reads an entire file into memory.\nreadFile {\nopen the file;\ndetermine its size;\nallocate that much memory;\nread the file into memory;\nclose the file;\n}\n\nAt first glance, this function seems simple enough, but it ignores all the following potential errors.\n\nWhat happens if the file can't be opened?\nWhat happens if the length of the file can't be determined?\nWhat happens if enough memory can't be allocated?\nWhat happens if the read fails?\nWhat happens if the file can't be closed?\n\nTo handle such cases, the readFile() function must have more code to do error detection, reporting, and handling. Here is an example of what the function might look like.\nerrorCodeType readFile {\ninitialize errorCode = 0;\nopen the file;\nif (theFileIsOpen) {\ndetermine the length of the file;\nif (gotTheFileLength) {\nallocate that much memory;\nif (gotEnoughMemory) {\nread the file into memory;\nif (readFailed) {\nerrorCode = -1;\n}\n} else {\nerrorCode = -2;\n}\n} else {\nerrorCode = -3;\n}\nclose the file;\nif (theFileDidntClose && errorCode == 0) {\nerrorCode = -4;\n} else {\nerrorCode = errorCode and -4;\n}\n} else {\nerrorCode = -5;\n}\nreturn errorCode;\n}\n\nExceptions enable you to write the main flow of your code and to deal with the exceptional cases elsewhere. If the readFile() function used exceptions instead of traditional error-management techniques, it would look more like the following.\nreadFile {\ntry {\nopen the file;\ndetermine its size;\nallocate that much memory;\nread the file into memory;\nclose the file;\n} catch (fileOpenFailed) {\ndoSomething;\n} catch (sizeDeterminationFailed) {\ndoSomething;\n} catch (memoryAllocationFailed) {\ndoSomething;\n} catch (readFailed) {\ndoSomething;\n} catch (fileCloseFailed) {\ndoSomething;\n}\n}\n\nNote that exceptions don't spare you the effort of doing the work of detecting, reporting, and handling errors, but they do help you organize the work more effectively.\n3.2 Advantage 2: Propagating Errors Up the Call Stack\nA second advantage of exceptions is the ability to propagate error reporting up the call stack of methods. Suppose that the readFile() method is the fourth method in a series of nested method calls made by the main program: method1 calls method2, which calls method3, which finally calls readFile.\nmethod1 {\ncall method2;\n}\n\nmethod2 {\ncall method3;\n}\n\nmethod3 {\ncall readFile;\n}\n\nSuppose also that method1 is the only method interested in the errors that might occur within readFile. Traditional error-notification techniques force method2 and method3 to propagate the error codes returned by readFile up the call stack until the error codes finally reach method1—the only method that is interested in them.\nmethod1 {\nerrorCodeType error;\nerror = call method2;\nif (error)\ndoErrorProcessing;\nelse\nproceed;\n}\n\nerrorCodeType method2 {\nerrorCodeType error;\nerror = call method3;\nif (error)\nreturn error;\nelse\nproceed;\n}\n\nerrorCodeType method3 {\nerrorCodeType error;\nerror = call readFile;\nif (error)\nreturn error;\nelse\nproceed;\n}\n\nRecall that the Java runtime environment searches backward through the call stack to find any methods that are interested in handling a particular exception. A method can duck any exceptions thrown within it, thereby allowing a method farther up the call stack to catch it. Hence, only the methods that care about errors have to worry about detecting errors.\nmethod1 {\ntry {\ncall method2;\n} catch (exception e) {\ndoErrorProcessing;\n}\n}\n\nmethod2 throws exception {\ncall method3;\n}\n\nmethod3 throws exception {\ncall readFile;\n}\n\nHowever, as the pseudocode shows, ducking an exception requires some effort on the part of the middleman methods. Any checked exceptions that can be thrown within a method must be specified in its throws clause.\n3.3 Advantage 3: Grouping and Differentiating Error Types\nBecause all exceptions thrown within a program are objects, the grouping or categorizing of exceptions is a natural outcome of the class hierarchy. An example of a group of related exception classes in the Java platform are those defined in java.io — IOException and its descendants. IOException is the most general and represents any type of error that can occur when performing I/O. Its descendants represent more specific errors. For example, FileNotFoundException means that a file could not be located on disk.\nA method can write specific handlers that can handle a very specific exception. The FileNotFoundException class has no descendants, so the following handler can handle only one type of exception.\ncatch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n...\n}\n\nA method can catch an exception based on its group or general type by specifying any of the exception's superclasses in the catch statement. For example, to catch all I/O exceptions, regardless of their specific type, an exception handler specifies an IOException argument.\ncatch (IOException e) {\n...\n}\n\nThis handler will be able to catch all I/O exceptions, including FileNotFoundException, EOFException, and so on. You can find details about what occurred by querying the argument passed to the exception handler. For example, use the following to print the stack trace.\ncatch (IOException e) {\n// Output goes to System.err.\ne.printStackTrace();\n// Send trace to stdout.\ne.printStackTrace(System.out);\n}\n\nYou could even set up an exception handler that handles any Exception with the handler here.\n// A (too) general exception handler\ncatch (Exception e) {\n...\n}\n\nThe Exception class is close to the top of the Throwable class hierarchy. Therefore, this handler will catch many other exceptions in addition to those that the handler is intended to catch. You may want to handle exceptions this way if all you want your program to do, for example, is print out an error message for the user and then exit.\nIn most situations, however, you want exception handlers to be as specific as possible. The reason is that the first thing a handler must do is determine what type of exception occurred before it can decide on the best recovery strategy. In effect, by not catching specific errors, the handler must accommodate any possibility. Exception handlers that are too general can make code more error-prone by catching and handling exceptions that weren't anticipated by the programmer and for which the handler was not intended.\nAs noted, you can create groups of exceptions and handle exceptions in a general fashion, or you can use the specific exception type to differentiate exceptions and handle exceptions in an exact fashion.\n4. Best Practice for Exception\n4.1 implement a re-try-catch\nEx1:\nint count = 0;\nint maxTries = 3;\nwhile(true) {\ntry {\n// Some Code\n// break out of loop, or return, on success\n} catch (SomeException e) {\n// handle exception\nif (++count == maxTries) { throw e;}\n}\n}\nEx2:\n//You can use AOP and Java annotations from jcabi-aspects\n@RetryOnFailure(attempts = 3, delay = 5)\npublic String load(URL url) {\nreturn url.openConnection().getContent();\n}\n4.2 Always add log in catch block\nExample one:\npublic void consumeAndForgetAllExceptions(){\ntry {\n...some code that throws exceptions\n} catch (Exception ex){\nex.printStacktrace();\n}\n}\n\nWhat is wrong with the code above?\nOnce an exception is thrown, normal program execution is suspended and control is transferred to the catch block. The catch block catches the exception and just suppresses it. Execution of the program continues after the catch block, as if nothing had happened.\nExample two:\npublic void someMethod() throws Exception{\n}\n\nThis method is a blank one; it does not have any code in it. How can a blank method throw exceptions? Java does not stop you from doing this. Recently, I came across similar code where the method was declared to throw exceptions, but there was no code that actually generated that exception. When I asked the programmer, he replied \"I know, it is corrupting the API, but I am used to doing it and it works.\"\nBroadly speaking, there are three different situations that cause exceptions to be thrown:\n\nExceptions due to programming errors(Runtime or unchecked exception): In this category, exceptions are generated due to programming errors (e.g., NullPointerException and IllegalArgumentException). The client code usually cannot do anything about programming errors.\n\nExceptions due to client code errors (checked exception): Client code attempts something not allowed by the API, and thereby violates its contract. The client can take some alternative course of action, if there is useful information provided in the exception. For example: an exception is thrown while parsing an XML document that is not well-formed. The exception contains useful information about the location in the XML document that causes the problem. The client can use this information to take recovery steps.\n\n\n\nExceptions due to resource failures: Exceptions that get generated when resources fail. For example: the system runs out of memory or a network connection fails. The client's response to resource failures is context-driven. The client can retry the operation after some time or just log the resource failure and bring the application to a halt.\nTypes of Exceptions in Java\n\nJava defines two kinds of exceptions:\n\nChecked exceptions: Exceptions that inherit from the Exception class are checked exceptions. It occurs at compile time. Client code has to handle the checked exceptions thrown by the API, either in a catch clause or by forwarding it outward with the throws clause.\n\nUnchecked exceptions: RuntimeException also extends from Exception. However, all of the exceptions that inherit from RuntimeException get special treatment. There is no requirement for the client code to deal with them, and hence they are called unchecked exceptions.\n\nThe difference between throws and throw keywords, throws is used to postpone the handling of a checked exception and throw is used to invoke an exception explicitly.\n\n\nA checked exception thrown by a lower layer is a forced contract on the invoking layer to catch or throw it. The checked exception contract between the API and its client soon changes into an unwanted burden if the client code is unable to deal with the exception effectively. Programmers of the client code may start taking shortcuts by suppressing the exception in an empty catch block or just throwing it and, in effect, placing the burden on the client's invoker.\nChecked exceptions are also accused of breaking encapsulation. Consider the following:\npublic List getAllAccounts() throws\nFileNotFoundException, SQLException{\n...\n}\nThe method getAllAccounts() throws two checked exceptions. The client of this method has to explicitly deal with the implementation-specific exceptions, even if it has no idea what file or database call has failed within getAllAccounts(), or has no business providing filesystem or database logic. Thus, the exception handling forces an inappropriately tight coupling between the method and its callers.\n"},"java-quick-review/chapter04_collections.html":{"url":"java-quick-review/chapter04_collections.html","title":"Collections","keywords":"","body":"Chapter IV: Collections\n\nInterface Structure\nThe Collection Interface\nSet\nList\nMap\n\n1.

A collection represents a group of objects known as its elements. \nCollections may have one or some following properties:\n\nAllow duplicate elements\nDo not allow duplicate elements: Set / Map (no duplicate keys)\nMaintain elements inserted order\nDo not maintain elements inserted order\nSorted\nUnsorted\nFirst-in, first-out (FIFO)\nLast-in, first-out (LIFO)\n\n1.2 Set\nA collection that cannot contain duplicate elements.\n1.3 List\nAn ordered collection (sometimes called a sequence).

It can order elements in a FIFO (first-in, first-out) manner.\n1.5 Deque\nA collection used to hold multiple elements prior to processing. Deques can be used both as FIFO (first-in, first-out) \nand LIFO (last-in, first-out). It implements both stacks and queues at the same time.\n1.6 Map\nAn object that maps keys to values. A Map cannot contain duplicate keys; each key can map to at most one value.\nThe last two core collection interfaces are merely sorted versions of Set and Map:\n1.7 SortedSet\nA Set that maintains its elements in ascending order.\n1.8 SortedMap\nA map that maintains its mappings in ascending key order. Sorted maps are used for naturally ordered collections of \nkey/value pairs, such as dictionaries and telephone directories.\n2. The Collection Interface\n2.1 Features\n\nStore a group of objects.\nVaried-size\nCannot store primitive type data\nUn-synchronized : basically all collection type are un-synchronized. Only these three are synchronized: \nHashtable (not from collection), Vector, Stack.\nTo make a collection synchronized: Collections.synchronizedCollection(Collection c)\n\n2.2 Traversing Collections\n\nUse for-each construct\nUse Iterators\nUse aggregate operations (JDK 8)\n\nfor-each construct\n  for (Object o : collection) { system.out.println(o)}\n\nIterators\n  public interface Iterator {\n  boolean hasNext();\n  E next();\n  void remove(); //optional\n  }\n\nThe remove method removes the last element that was returned by next.

The for-each construct hides the iterator, so you cannot call remove. \nTherefore, the for-each construct is not usable for filtering.\nIterate over multiple collections in parallel.\nstatic void filter(Collection c) {\nfor (Iterator it = c.iterator(); it.hasNext(); )\nif (!cond(it.next()))\nit.remove();\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAggregate Operations (Java 8)\n  myShapesCollection.stream()\n  .filter(e -> e.getColor() == Color.RED)\n  .forEach(e -> System.out.println(e.getName()));\n\n\n2.3 APIs\n\nBulk Operations\nArray Operations\n\n2.3.1 Bulk Operations\n\ncontainsAll: returns true if the target Collection contains all of the elements in the specified Collection.\n\naddAll: adds all of the elements in the specified Collection to the target Collection.\n\nremoveAll: removes from the target Collection all of its elements that are also contained in the specified Collection.\n\nretainAll: removes from the target Collection all its elements that are not also contained in the specified Collection. That is, it retains only those elements in the target Collection that are also contained in the specified Collection.\n\nclear: removes all elements from the Collection.\n\n\n2.3.2\n\ntoArray ( )\nArrays.asList ( )\n\nThe toArray methods are provided as a bridge between collections and older APIs that expect arrays on input. \nThe array operations allow the contents of a Collection to be translated into an array.\n// c is a Collection.

Set\nSet does not contain duplicate elements\n\nUn-sorted: HashSet  (do not keep insert order )\nUn-sorted: LinkedHashSet  (keep insert order )\nSorted: TreeSet\n\n3.1 HashSet\n\nUse hashCode and equals to check uniqueness  (element must override hashCode and equals methods )\nIf hashCode is different, save element into HashSet. No need to check equals().\nIf hashCode is same, but not equals, save element into HashSet.\nIf both hashCode and equals are same, duplicate elements. Do not save it.\nHashSet permits null.\n\n3.2 TreeSet\n\nSorting method 1: Element itself comparable\n\nElement implements Comparable interface\n\nOverride compareTo ( )\nIf element itself has nature order, like String, no need to implement Comparable interface.\n\nSorting method 2: Construct TreeSet with Comparator\n\nCreate a customized comparator class which implements Comparator interface\n\nOverride compare ( ) method\nNote: TreeSet's comparator will override object's compareTo ( ) method.\n  public class ComparatorByLength implements Comparator {\n      @Override\n      public int compare(Object o1, Object o2) {\n      String s1 = (String)o1;\n      String s2 = (String)o2;\n\n      int temp = s1.length()-s2.length();\n      return temp==0? s1.compareTo(s2): temp;\n      // return 1; // keep inserting order\n      // return -1 // keep inverse-inserting order\n      }\n  }\n\n  TreeSet ts = new TreeSet(new ComparatorByLength());\n\n\n4. List\n\nArray: It is simple fixed size arrays that can contains both primitive data and object. \nList List only supports objects.\nVector:synchronized, CRUD performance is low.\nArrayList: dynamic size array, un-synchronized, CRUD performance is faster than Vector  (designed to replace vector ). \nRead and update are faster than LinkedList. Write in sequence is faster than LinkedList. It is not good for \nrandom add and delete elements.\nLinkedList:un-synchronized, random add and delete are faster than ArrayList。\n\nLinkedList VS ArrayList\n\nLinkedList store elements within a doubly-linked list data structure.\nLinkedList allows for constant-time insertions or removals, but only sequential access of elements.\nLinkedList costs more memory\nArrayList: allow random access, so you can grab any element in constant time.\nArrayList: random adding and removing are slower than LinkedList.\n\n\nArrayList Auto resizing\n\nEach ArrayList instance has a capacity. The capacity is the size of the array used to store the elements in \nthe list. It is always at least as large as the list size. As elements are added to an ArrayList, its capacity \ngrows automatically. The details of the growth policy are not specified beyond the fact that adding an \nelement has constant amortized time cost.\n\n\n\n5. Map\n\nMap：adds  (key, value ), whereas Collection adds element.\nkey must be unique\nkey can be null, but can only have one\n\nHashMap does not call hashcode when null is passed as key and null Key is handled as special case.\nPut Method: HashMap puts null key in bucket 0 and maps null as key to passed value. HashMap does it by linked \nlist data structure. HashMap uses linked list data structure internally. Linked list data structure used by HashMap \n(a static class in HashMap.java)\n  static class Entry implements Map.Entry {\n          final K key;\n          V value;\n          Entry next;\n          final int hash;\n  }\n  In Entry class the K is set to null and value mapped to value passed in put method.\n\nGet Method: While in Hashmap get method the checks if key is passed as null. Search Value for null key \nin bucket 0. Hence there can only be one null key in one hashmap object.\n\n\n\n\n5.1 APIs\n\nAdd\nput(K key, V value)\n// Return: Associates the specified value with the specified key in this map (optional // operation).\n\nDelete\nvoid clear()// Removes all of the mappings from this map (optional operation).\nvalue remove(key)//Removes the mapping for a key from this map if it is present (optional operation).\n\nCheck\nboolean containsKey(key)//Returns true if this map contains a mapping for the specified key.\nboolean containsValue(value)//Returns true if this map maps one or more keys to the specified value.\nboolean isEmpty()//Returns true if this map contains no key-value mappings.\n\nGet\nvalue get(key)//Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or null if this map contains no mapping for the key.\nint size()//Returns the number of key-value mappings in this map.\n\n\n5.2 Implementations\n\nHashtable :Synchronized, null cannot be key or value.\nHashMap : Un-synchronized and permits one null key and any number of null values. \nIf you store the same key, like null, the value will be updated.\nLinkedHashMap: it is similar to HashMap, but keeps insert order.\nTreeMap : The TreeMap is sorted according to the natural ordering of its keys, or by a Comparator provided at map creation time, \ndepending on which constructor is used.\nHashMap and HashTable check key  (check both hasCode and equals )\n  if (key1.hashCode() == key2.hashCode() && key1.equals(key2)) { return true;}\n\nHashMap and HashTable check value  (only check equals )\n  if (value1.equals(value2)) { return true;}\n\nAbout null key in HashTable and HashTable:\n\nTo successfully store and retrieve objects from a HashTable, the objects used as keys must implement the hashCode method and \nthe equals method. Since null is not an object, it can't implement these methods.\nHashMap has a defensive check for null key. If key == null, it won't implement hashCode(), but puts null key in bucket 0 and\nmaps null as key to passed value.\n\n\nDeclare a HashMap\n// default values: initialCapacity = 16, loadFactor = 0.75\n// when m.size() > initialCapacity * loadFactor, it will automatic auto resizing.\nHashMap m = new HashMap(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor);\n6.

Synchronization, Fail-fast and Fail-safe Iterators\n8.1 Write a synchronized list\nList list = new ArrayList(); //un-synchronized\nlist = MyCollections.synList(list);// return a synchronized list.\n\n// add synchronization\nclass MyCollections{\n    public static List synList(List list){ return new MyList(list); }\n    private class MyList implements List{\n        private List list;\n        private static final Object lock = new Object();\n        MyList(List list){ this.list = list; }\n\n        public boolean add(Object obj){ synchronized(lock){ return list.add(obj);} }\n\n        public boolean remove(Object obj){ synchronized(lock){ return list.remove(obj);} }\n    }\n}\n8.2 Fail-fast and Fail-safe Iterators\nConcurrent Modification: When more threads are iterating over a collection, in between, one thread changes the structure of \nthe collection  (either adding the element to the collection or by deleting the element in the collection or by updating the \nvalue at particular position in the collection ) is known as Concurrent Modification.\nNOTE: structural modification is any operation that ADD or delete element;\nNOT A STRUCTURAL MODIFICATION: merely setting the value of an element  (in case of list ) or changing the value associated \nwith an existing key  (in case of map ).\n\nFail-fast iterator: when add or delete concurrent modification applies on a un-synchronized collection, fail-fast iterator \nthrows ConcurrentModificationException.\n\nFail-safe iterator: allows add or delete concurrent modification applies on a concurrent version of collection. \nFail Safe Iterator makes copy of the internal data structure  (object array ) and iterates over the copied data structure. \nSo , original data structure remains structurally unchanged. Hence , no ConcurrentModificationException throws by the fail \nsafe iterator.\n\n\npublic class FailFastExample{\n    public static void main(String[] args){\n        Map premiumPhone = new HashMap();\n        premiumPhone.put(\"Apple\", \"iPhone\");\n        premiumPhone.put(\"HTC\", \"HTC one\");\n        premiumPhone.put(\"Samsung\",\"S5\");\n\n        Iterator iterator = premiumPhone.keySet().iterator();\n\n        while (iterator.hasNext()){\n            System.out.println(premiumPhone.get(iterator.next()));\n            premiumPhone.put(\"Sony\", \"Xperia Z\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Output:\niPhone\nException in thread \"main\" java.util.ConcurrentModificationException\nat java.util.HashMap$HashIterator.nextEntry(Unknown Source)\nat java.util.HashMap$KeyIterator.next(Unknown Source)\nat FailFastExample.main(FailFastExample.java:20)\npublic class FailSafeExample{\n    public static void main(String[] args){\n        ConcurrentHashMap premiumPhone = new ConcurrentHashMap();\n        premiumPhone.put(\"Apple\", \"iPhone\");\n        premiumPhone.put(\"HTC\", \"HTC one\");\n        premiumPhone.put(\"Samsung\",\"S5\");\n\n        Iterator iterator = premiumPhone.keySet().iterator();\n\n        while (iterator.hasNext()){\n            System.out.println(premiumPhone.get(iterator.next()));\n            premiumPhone.put(\"Sony\", \"Xperia Z\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n// Output:\nS5\nHTC one\niPhone\n\n9. Collections\nCollections is a class that consists exclusively of static methods that operate on or return collections. It contains polymorphic \nalgorithms that operate on collections, \"wrappers\", which return a new collection backed by a specified collection, \nand a few other odds and ends.\nIt provides manipulations on Set, List, Map, etc.\n9.1 Sort Operation\n\nreverse (List )\nshuffle (List )\nsort (List )\nsort (List，Comparator )\nswap (List，int， int )\n\n9.2 Search and Replace\n\nObject max (Collection )\nObject max (Collection，Comparator )\nObject min (Collection )\nObject min (Collection，Comparator )\nint frequency (Collection，Object )\nboolean replaceAll (List list，Object oldVal，Object newVal )\n\n9.3 Synchronized Methods\nCollections.synchronizedCollection(Collection c)\nCollections.synchronizedList(List c)\nCollections.synchronizedSet(Set c)\nCollections.synchronizedSortedSet(SortedSet c)\nCollections.synchronizedMap(Map c)\nCollections.synchronizedSortedMap(SortedMap c)\n9.4 Algorithms\nThe polymorphic algorithms described here are pieces of reusable functionality provided by the Java platform. All of them come \nfrom the Collections class, and all take the form of static methods whose first argument is the collection on which the operation \nis to be performed. The great majority of the algorithms provided by the Java platform operate on List instances, but a few of \nthem operate on arbitrary Collection instances. This section briefly describes the following algorithms:\n\nSorting\nShuffling\nRoutine Data Manipulation\nSearching\nComposition\nFinding Extreme Values\n\nSorting\nThe sort algorithm reorders a List so that its elements are in ascending order according to an ordering relationship.\n* sort (List )\n* sort (List，Comparator )\nThe sort operation uses a slightly optimized merge sort algorithm that is fast and stable:\n\nFast: It is guaranteed to run in nlog(n) time and runs substantially faster on nearly sorted lists. Empirical tests showed \nit to be as fast as a highly optimized quicksort. A quicksort is generally considered to be faster than a merge sort but isn't stable \nand doesn't guarantee nlog(n) performance.\nStable: It doesn't reorder equal elements. This is important if you sort the same list repeatedly on different attributes. \nIf a user of a mail program sorts the inbox by mailing date and then sorts it by sender, the user naturally expects \nthat the now-contiguous list of messages from a given sender will  (still ) be sorted by mailing date. \nThis is guaranteed only if the second sort was stable.\nQuicksort can be used to primitive type data which does not have stable issue.\n\nThe following trivial program prints out its arguments in lexicographic  (alphabetical ) order.\npublic class Sort {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        List list = Arrays.asList(args);\n        Collections.sort(list);\n        System.out.println(list);\n    }\n}\n\nLet's run the program.\n% java Sort i walk the line\nThe following output is produced:\n[i, line, the, walk]\nThe second form of sort takes a Comparator in addition to a List and sorts the elements with the Comparator.\nRecall that the anagram groups are stored as values in a Map, in the form of List instances. The revised printing code iterates through \nthe Map's values view, putting every List that passes the minimum-size test into a List of Lists. Then the code sorts this List, using a \nComparator that expects List instances, and implements reverse size-ordering. Finally, the code iterates through the sorted List, \nprinting its elements  (the anagram groups ). The following code replaces the printing code at the end of the main method in the Anagrams example.\n// Make a List of all anagram groups above size threshold.\nList> winners = new ArrayList>();\nfor (List l : m.values())\nif (l.size() >= minGroupSize)\nwinners.add(l);\n\n// Sort anagram groups according to size\nCollections.sort(winners, new Comparator>() {\npublic int compare(List o1, List o2) {\nreturn o2.size() - o1.size();\n}});\n\n// Print anagram groups.\nfor (List l : winners)\nSystem.out.println(l.size() + \": \" + l);\nRunning the program on the same dictionary as in The Map Interface section, with the same minimum anagram group size  (eight ), \nproduces the following output.\n12: [apers, apres, asper, pares, parse, pears, prase, presa, rapes, reaps, spare, spear]\n11: [alerts, alters, artels, estral, laster, ratels,salter, slater, staler, stelar, talers]\n10: [least, setal, slate, stale, steal, stela, taels,tales, teals, tesla]\n9: [estrin, inerts, insert, inters, niters, nitres, sinter, triens, trines]\n9: [capers, crapes, escarp, pacers, parsec, recaps,scrape, secpar, spacer]\n9: [palest, palets, pastel, petals, plates, pleats,septal, staple, tepals]\n9: [anestri, antsier, nastier, ratines, retains, retinas,retsina, stainer, stearin]\n8: [lapse, leaps, pales, peals, pleas, salep, sepal, spale]\n8: [aspers, parses, passer, prases, repass, spares,sparse, spears]\n8: [enters, nester, renest, rentes, resent, tenser,ternes,treens]\n8: [arles, earls, lares, laser, lears, rales, reals, seral]\n8: [earings, erasing, gainers, reagins, regains, reginas,searing, seringa]\n8: [peris, piers, pries, prise, ripes, speir, spier, spire]\n8: [ates, east, eats, etas, sate, seat, seta, teas]\n8: [carets, cartes, caster, caters, crates, reacts,recast,traces]\nShuffling\nThe shuffle algorithm does the opposite of what sort does, destroying any trace of order that may have been present in a List. \nThat is, this algorithm reorders the List based on input from a source of randomness such that all possible permutations occur \nwith equal likelihood, assuming a fair source of randomness. This algorithm is useful in implementing games of chance. \nFor example, it could be used to shuffle a List of Card objects representing a deck. Also, it's useful for generating test cases.\nThis operation has two forms: one takes a List and uses a default source of randomness, and the other requires the caller to provide a \nRandom object to use as a source of randomness. The code for this algorithm is used as an example in the List section.\nRoutine Data Manipulation\nThe Collections class provides five algorithms for doing routine data manipulation on List objects, all of which are pretty straightforward:\n\nreverse — reverses the order of the elements in a List.\nfill — overwrites every element in a List with the specified value. This operation is useful for reinitializing a List.\ncopy — takes two arguments, a destination List and a source List, and copies the elements of the source into the destination, overwriting its contents. The destination List must be at least as long as the source. If it is longer, the remaining elements in the destination List are unaffected.\nswap — swaps the elements at the specified positions in a List.\naddAll — adds all the specified elements to a Collection. The elements to be added may be specified individually or as an array.\n\nSearching\nThe binarySearch algorithm searches for a specified element in a sorted List. This algorithm has two forms.\n\nCollections.binarySearch (list, key )\nCollections.binarySearch (list, key, comparator )\n\nThe return value is the same for both forms.\n\nIf the List contains the search key, its index is returned.\nIf not, the return value is  (- (insertion point ) - 1 ), where the insertion point is the point at which the value would be \ninserted into the List, or the index of the first element greater than the value or list.size() if all elements in the List are \nless than the specified value. This admittedly ugly formula guarantees that the return value will be >= 0 if and only if \nthe search key is found. It's basically a hack to combine a boolean  (found ) and an integer  (index ) into a single int return value.\n\nThe following idiom, usable with both forms of the binarySearch operation, looks for the specified search key and inserts it at \nthe appropriate position if it's not already present.\nint pos = Collections.binarySearch(list, key);\nif (pos Composition\nThe frequency and disjoint algorithms test some aspect of the composition of one or more Collections:\n\nfrequency — counts the number of times the specified element occurs in the specified collection\ndisjoint — determines whether two Collections are disjoint; that is, whether they contain no elements in common\n\nFinding Extreme Values\nThe min and the max algorithms return, respectively, the minimum and maximum element contained in a specified Collection. \nBoth of these operations come in two forms. The simple form takes only a Collection and returns the minimum  (or maximum ) \nelement according to the elements' natural ordering. The second form takes a Comparator in addition to the Collection and \nreturns the minimum  (or maximum ) element according to the specified Comparator.\n10. Custom Collection Implementations\nReasons to Write an Implementation\n\nPersistent\nApplication-specific\nHigh-performance, special-purpose\nHigh-performance, general-purpose\nEnhanced functionality\nConvenience\nAdapter\n\nHow to Write a Custom Implementation\nThe Java Collections Framework provides abstract implementations designed expressly to facilitate custom implementations.\npublic static  List asList(T[] a) {\n    return new MyArrayList(a);\n}\n\nprivate static class MyArrayList extends AbstractList {\n    private final T[] a;\n    MyArrayList(T[] array) {\n    a = array;\n}\n\npublic T get(int index) {\n    return a[index];\n}\n\npublic T set(int index, T element) {\n    T oldValue = a[index];\n    a[index] = element;\n    return oldValue;\n}\n\npublic int size() {\n    return a.length;\n}\n}\nBelieve it or not, this is very close to the implementation that is contained in java.util.Arrays. It's that simple! \nYou provide a constructor and the get, set, and size methods, and AbstractList does all the rest. You get the ListIterator, \nbulk operations, search operations, hash code computation, comparison, and string representation for free.\nSuppose you want to make the implementation a bit faster. The API documentation for abstract implementations describes \nprecisely how each method is implemented, so you'll know which methods to override to get the performance you want. \nThe preceding implementation's performance is fine, but it can be improved a bit. In particular, the toArray method \niterates over the List, copying one element at a time. Given the internal representation, it's a lot faster and \nmore sensible just to clone the array.\npublic Object[] toArray() {\n    return (Object[]) a.clone();\n}\nWith the addition of this override and a few more like it, this implementation is exactly the one found in java.util.Arrays. \nIn the interest of full disclosure, it's a bit tougher to use the other abstract implementations because you will have to \nwrite your own iterator, but it's still not that difficult.\nThe following list summarizes the abstract implementations:\n\nAbstractCollection — a Collection that is neither a Set nor a List. At a minimum, you must provide the iterator \nand the size methods.\nAbstractSet — a Set; use is identical to AbstractCollection.\nAbstractList — a List backed up by a random-access data store, such as an array. At a minimum, you must provide \nthe positional access methods  (get and, optionally, set, remove, and add ) and the size method. The abstract class \ntakes care of listIterator  (and iterator ).\nAbstractSequentialList — a List backed up by a sequential-access data store, such as a linked list. At a minimum, \nyou must provide the listIterator and size methods. The abstract class takes care of the positional access methods.(This is the opposite of AbstractList. )\nAbstractQueue — at a minimum, you must provide the offer, peek, poll, and size methods and an iterator supporting remove.\nAbstractMap — a Map. At a minimum you must provide the entrySet view. This is typically implemented with the \nAbstractSet class. If the Map is modifiable, you must also provide the put method.\n\nThe process of writing a custom implementation follows:\n\nChoose the appropriate abstract implementation class from the preceding list.\nProvide implementations for all the abstract methods of the class. If your custom collection is to be modifiable, \nyou will have to override one or more of the concrete methods as well. The API documentation for the abstract \nimplementation class will tell you which methods to override.\nTest and, if necessary, debug the implementation. You now have a working custom collection implementation.\nIf you are concerned about performance, read the API documentation of the abstract implementation class for \nall the methods whose implementations you're inheriting. If any seem too slow, override them. If you override any methods, be sure to measure the performance of the method before and after the override. How much effort you put into tweaking performance should be a function of how much use the implementation will get and how critical to performance its use is.  (Often this step is best omitted. )\n\n11. Interoperability\n\nCompatibility: This subsection describes how collections can be made to work with older APIs that predate \nthe addition of Collections to the Java platform.\nAPI Design: This subsection describes how to design new APIs so that they will interoperate seamlessly with one another.\n\n11.1 Compatibility\nThe Java Collections Framework was designed to ensure complete interoperability between the core collection \ninterfaces and the types that were used to represent collections in the early versions of the Java platform: \nVector, Hashtable, array, and Enumeration. In this section, you'll learn how to transform old collections to the \nJava Collections Framework collections and vice versa.\nUpward Compatibility\nSuppose that you're using an API that returns legacy collections in tandem with another API that requires objects implementing \nthe collection interfaces. To make the two APIs interoperate smoothly, you'll have to transform the legacy collections into \nmodern collections. Luckily, the Java Collections Framework makes this easy.\nSuppose the old API returns an array of objects and the new API requires a Collection. The Collections Framework has a \nconvenience implementation that allows an array of objects to be viewed as a List. You use Arrays.asList to pass an array \nto any method requiring a Collection or a List.\nFoo[] result = oldMethod(arg);\nnewMethod(Arrays.asList(result));\nIf the old API returns a Vector or a Hashtable, you have no work to do at all because Vector was retrofitted to implement \nthe List interface, and Hashtable was retrofitted to implement Map. Therefore, a Vector may be passed directly to any method \ncalling for a Collection or a List.\nVector result = oldMethod(arg);\nnewMethod(result);\nSimilarly, a Hashtable may be passed directly to any method calling for a Map.\nHashtable result = oldMethod(arg);\nnewMethod(result);\nLess frequently, an API may return an Enumeration that represents a collection of objects. The Collections.list method \ntranslates an Enumeration into a Collection.\nEnumeration e = oldMethod(arg);\nnewMethod(Collections.list(e));\nBackward Compatibility\nSuppose you're using an API that returns modern collections in tandem with another API that requires you to pass in legacy \ncollections. To make the two APIs interoperate smoothly, you have to transform modern collections into old collections. \nAgain, the Java Collections Framework makes this easy.\nSuppose the new API returns a Collection, and the old API requires an array of Object. As you're probably aware, the \nCollection interface contains a toArray method designed expressly for this situation.\nCollection c = newMethod();\noldMethod(c.toArray());\nWhat if the old API requires an array of String  (or another type ) instead of an array of Object? You just use \nthe other form of toArray — the one that takes an array on input.\nCollection c = newMethod();\noldMethod((String[]) c.toArray(new String[0]));\nIf the old API requires a Vector, the standard collection constructor comes in handy.\nCollection c = newMethod();\noldMethod(new Vector(c));\nThe case where the old API requires a Hashtable is handled analogously.\nMap m = newMethod();\noldMethod(new Hashtable(m));\nFinally, what do you do if the old API requires an Enumeration? This case isn't common, but it does happen from time \nto time, and the Collections.enumeration method was provided to handle it. This is a static factory method that takes a \nCollection and returns an Enumeration over the elements of the Collection.\nCollection c = newMethod();\noldMethod(Collections.enumeration(c));\n11.2 API Design\nIn this short but important section, you'll learn a few simple guidelines that will allow your API to interoperate \nseamlessly with all other APIs that follow these guidelines. In essence, these rules define what it takes to be a \ngood \"citizen\" in the world of collections.\nParameters\n\nIf your API contains a method that requires a collection on input, it is of paramount importance that you declare the \nrelevant parameter type to be one of the collection interface types. Never use an implementation type because this defeats \nthe purpose of an interface-based Collections Framework, which is to allow collections to be manipulated without regard \nto implementation details.\n\nFurther, you should always use the least-specific type that makes sense. For example, don't require a List or a \nSet if a Collection would do. It's not that you should never require a List or a Set on input; it is correct to do \nso if a method depends on a property of one of these interfaces. For example, many of the algorithms provided by \nthe Java platform require a List on input because they depend on the fact that lists are ordered. As a general rule, \nhowever, the best types to use on input are the most general: Collection and Map.\n\nCaution: Never define your own ad hoc collection class and require objects of this class on input. \nBy doing this, you'd lose all the benefits provided by the Java Collections Framework.\n\n\nReturn Values\n\nYou can afford to be much more flexible with return values than with input parameters. It's fine to return an \nobject of any type that implements or extends one of the collection interfaces. This can be one of the interfaces or \na special-purpose type that extends or implements one of these interfaces.\n\nFor example, one could imagine an image-processing package, called ImageList, that returned objects of a new class \nthat implements List. In addition to the List operations, ImageList could support any application-specific operations \nthat seemed desirable. For example, it might provide an indexImage operation that returned an image containing thumbnail \nimages of each graphic in the ImageList. It's critical to note that even if the API furnishes ImageList instances on output, \nit should accept arbitrary Collection  (or perhaps List ) instances on input.\n\nIn one sense, return values should have the opposite behavior of input parameters: It's best to return the most \nspecific applicable collection interface rather than the most general. For example, if you're sure that you'll \nalways return a SortedMap, you should give the relevant method the return type of SortedMap rather than Map. \nSortedMap instances are more time-consuming to build than ordinary Map instances and are also more powerful. \nGiven that your module has already invested the time to build a SortedMap, it makes good sense to give the user \naccess to its increased power. Furthermore, the user will be able to pass the returned object to methods that demand \na SortedMap, as well as those that accept any Map.\n\n\nLegacy APIs\nThere are currently plenty of APIs out there that define their own ad hoc collection types. While this is unfortunate, \nit's a fact of life, given that there was no Collections Framework in the first two major releases of the Java platform. \nSuppose you own one of these APIs; here's what you can do about it.\n\nIf possible, retrofit your legacy collection type to implement one of the standard collection interfaces. \nThen all the collections you return will interoperate smoothly with other collection-based APIs. If this is impossible(for example, because one or more of the preexisting type signatures conflict with the standard collection interfaces ), \ndefine an adapter class that wraps one of your legacy collections objects, allowing it to function as a standard collection.(The Adapter class is an example of a custom implementation. )\n\nRetrofit your API with new calls that follow the input guidelines to accept objects of a standard collection interface, \nif possible. Such calls can coexist with the calls that take the legacy collection type. If this is impossible, \nprovide a constructor or static factory for your legacy type that takes an object of one of the standard interfaces \nand returns a legacy collection containing the same elements  (or mappings ). Either of these approaches will \nallow users to pass arbitrary collections into your API.\n\n\n12.

Why Generics\nBefore JDK 1.5, compiler can only guarantee return type is object. To return an Integer, you have to use casting. So it is easy to generate runtime error (ClassCastException) consequence.\nList myIntList = new ArrayList();// line 1\nmyIntList.add(new Integer(0));// line 2\nInteger x = (Integer) myIntList.iterator().next();// cast\n\nGenerics is designed to solve above drawback.

Processes and Threads\nIn concurrent programming, there are two basic units of execution: processes and threads. Most implementations of the Java virtual machine run as a single process.\n\nProcesses\n\nA process has a self-contained execution environment. A process generally has a complete, private set of basic run-time resources; in particular, each process has its own memory space. To facilitate communication between processes, most operating systems support Inter Process Communication (IPC) resources, such as pipes and sockets. IPC is used not just for communication between processes on the same system, but processes on different systems.\n\nThreads\n\nThreads exist within a process — every process has at least one. Threads share the process's resources, including memory and open files. This makes for efficient, but potentially problematic, communication.\nEvery application has at least one thread — or several, if you count \"system\" threads that do things like memory management and signal handling. But from the application programmer's point of view, you start with just one thread, called the main thread. This thread has the ability to create additional threads.\n2. Implement Multithread\n\nextends Thread \n\n1. Thread() // create a new thread object\n2. Thread(Runnable target) // create a new thread object based on Runnable\n3. Thread(Runnable t, String name) // assign a name for thread\n4. Thread(String name) // create a new thread object with an assgned name\n\nimplement Runnable\n\n1. Need to @Overrid run()\n2. It is good for shared resources scenario.\nExample: \n// Extends Thread\npublic class MyThread extends Thread {\n@Override\npublic void run() {\nfor (int i = 0; i // Implement Runnable\npublic class MyRunnable implements Runnable {\n@Override\npublic void run() {\nfor(int i = 0; i // Test two cases\npublic class A_StartingThreads {\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\nMyThread myThread = new MyThread();\nmyThread.run();\nMyRunnable myRunnable = new MyRunnable();\nmyRunnable.run();\n\n/*\n* Common pitfall: Calling run() instead of start()\n* */\nThread thread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());\nthread.start();\nfor (int i = 0; i Summary:\nNote: Use start() to invoke Thread, not run() method.\n* Runnable way is preferable.\n1 When having the Runnable's executed by a thread pool it is easy to queue up the Runnable instances until a thread from the pool is idle.\n2 Sometimes you may have to implement Runnable as well as subclass Thread. For instance, if creating a subclass of Thread that can execute more than one Runnable.\n3. Thread Life Cycle\n\nFive States: \n\nNEW\nRunnable\nRunning (yield)\nBlocking (wait / sleep / suspend)\nDead\n\nsleep() method:\nThread.sleep(1000) // sleep 1 second\n\n// interrupt() can wake up the sleep thread\njoin() method:\n@Override\npublic void run() {\n// some job\nThread_out.join(); // current thread will be blocked until this Thread_out completes its job\n}\nisAlive(): it is used to check if current thread is runnable or running.\n3. Thread Priority\n\nJava uses [1 - 10] to setup priority. 10 has the highest priority and 0 has the lowest priority.\n\n3 constant thread priority\n\nMAX_PRIORITY: 10\nMIN_PRIORITY: 0\nNORM_PRIORITY: 5\n\nThread.setPriority() / Thread.getPriority()\n\n\nNote: JVM cannot guarantee that the higher priority thread will run before the lower ones.\n4. Thread Synchronization\n\nThread Interference describes how errors are introduced when multiple threads access shared data.\nMemory Consistency Errors describes errors that result from inconsistent views of shared memory.\nSynchronized Methods describes a simple idiom that can effectively prevent thread interference and memory consistency errors.\nImplicit Locks and Synchronization describes a more general synchronization idiom, and describes how synchronization is based on implicit locks.\nAtomic Access talks about the general idea of operations that can't be interfered with by other threads.\n\n4.1 Thread Interference\nConsider a simple class called Counter\nclass Counter {\nprivate int c = 0;\npublic void increment() {\nc++;\n}\npublic void decrement() {\nc--;\n}\npublic int value() {\nreturn c;\n}\n}\n\nInterference happens when two operations, running in different threads, but acting on the same data, interleave. This means that the two operations consist of multiple steps, and the sequences of steps overlap.\nNote the single expression c++ can be decomposed into three steps:\nRetrieve the current value of c.\nIncrement the retrieved value by 1.\nStore the incremented value back in c.\nSuppose Thread A invokes increment at about the same time Thread B invokes decrement. If the initial value of c is 0, their interleaved actions might follow this sequence:\n1. Thread A: Retrieve c.\n2. Thread B: Retrieve c.\n3. Thread A: Increment retrieved value; result is 1.\n4. Thread B: Decrement retrieved value; result is -1.\n5. Thread A: Store result in c; c is now 1.\n6. Thread B: Store result in c; c is now -1.\nThread A's result is lost, overwritten by Thread B. This particular interleaving is only one possibility. Under different circumstances it might be Thread B's result that gets lost, or there could be no error at all. Because they are unpredictable, thread interference bugs can be difficult to detect and fix.\n4.2 Memory Consistency Errors\nMemory consistency errors occur when different threads have inconsistent views of what should be the same data. The programmer does not need a detailed understanding of these causes. All that is needed is a strategy for avoiding them.\nThe key to avoiding memory consistency errors is understanding the happens-before relationship. This relationship is simply a guarantee that memory writes by one specific statement are visible to another specific statement. To see this, consider the following example. Suppose a simple int field is defined and initialized:\nint counter = 0;\n\nThe counter field is shared between two threads, A and B. Suppose thread A increments counter:\ncounter++;\n\nThen, shortly afterwards, thread B prints out counter:\nSystem.out.println(counter);\n\nIf the two statements had been executed in the same thread, it would be safe to assume that the value printed out would be 1. But if the two statements are executed in separate threads, the value printed out might well be 0, because there's no guarantee that thread A's change to counter will be visible to thread B — unless the programmer has established a happens-before relationship between these two statements.\nThere are several actions that create happens-before relationships. One of them is synchronization, as we will see in the following sections.\nWe've already seen two actions that create happens-before relationships.\n\nWhen a statement invokes Thread.start, every statement that has a happens-before relationship with that statement also has a happens-before relationship with every statement executed by the new thread. The effects of the code that led up to the creation of the new thread are visible to the new thread.\nWhen a thread terminates and causes a Thread.join in another thread to return, then all the statements executed by the terminated thread have a happens-before relationship with all the statements following the successful join. The effects of the code in the thread are now visible to the thread that performed the join.\n\nFor a list of actions that create happens-before relationships, refer to the Summary page of the java.util.concurrent package..\n4.3 Synchronized Methods\nThe Java programming language provides two basic synchronization idioms:\n\nsynchronized methods\nsynchronized statements\n\nThis section is about synchronized methods.\nTo make a method synchronized, simply add the synchronized keyword to its declaration:\npublic class SynchronizedCounter {\nprivate int c = 0;\n\npublic synchronized void increment() {\nc++;\n}\n\npublic synchronized void decrement() {\nc--;\n}\n\npublic synchronized int value() {\nreturn c;\n}\n}\n\nIf count is an instance of SynchronizedCounter, then making these methods synchronized has two effects:\n\nFirst, it is not possible for two invocations of synchronized methods on the same object to interleave. When one thread is executing a synchronized method for an object, all other threads that invoke synchronized methods for the same object block (suspend execution) until the first thread is done with the object.\nSecond, when a synchronized method exits, it automatically establishes a happens-before relationship with any subsequent invocation of a synchronized method for the same object. This guarantees that changes to the state of the object are visible to all threads.\n\nNote that constructors cannot be synchronized — using the synchronized keyword with a constructor is a syntax error. Synchronizing constructors doesn't make sense, because only the thread that creates an object should have access to it while it is being constructed.\nWarning: When constructing an object that will be shared between threads, be very careful that a reference to the object does not \"leak\" prematurely. For example, suppose you want to maintain a List called instances containing every instance of class. You might be tempted to add the following line to your constructor:\ninstances.add(this);\n\nBut then other threads can use instances to access the object before construction of the object is complete.\nSynchronized methods enable a simple strategy for preventing thread interference and memory consistency errors: if an object is visible to more than one thread, all reads or writes to that object's variables are done through synchronized methods. (An important exception: final fields, which cannot be modified after the object is constructed, can be safely read through non-synchronized methods, once the object is constructed) This strategy is effective, but can present problems with liveness, as we'll see later in this lesson.\n4.4 Intrinsic Locks and Synchronization\nSynchronization is built around an internal entity known as the intrinsic lock or monitor lock. (The API specification often refers to this entity simply as a \"monitor.\") Intrinsic locks play a role in both aspects of synchronization: enforcing exclusive access to an object's state and establishing happens-before relationships that are essential to visibility.\nEvery object has an intrinsic lock associated with it. By convention, a thread that needs exclusive and consistent access to an object's fields has to acquire the object's intrinsic lock before accessing them, and then release the intrinsic lock when it's done with them. A thread is said to own the intrinsic lock between the time it has acquired the lock and released the lock. As long as a thread owns an intrinsic lock, no other thread can acquire the same lock. The other thread will block when it attempts to acquire the lock.\nWhen a thread releases an intrinsic lock, a happens-before relationship is established between that action and any subsequent acquisition of the same lock.\nLocks In Synchronized Methods\nWhen a thread invokes a synchronized method, it automatically acquires the intrinsic lock for that method's object and releases it when the method returns. The lock release occurs even if the return was caused by an uncaught exception.\nYou might wonder what happens when a static synchronized method is invoked, since a static method is associated with a class, not an object. In this case, the thread acquires the intrinsic lock for the Class object associated with the class. Thus access to class's static fields is controlled by a lock that's distinct from the lock for any instance of the class.\nSynchronized Statements\nAnother way to create synchronized code is with synchronized statements. Unlike synchronized methods, synchronized statements must specify the object that provides the intrinsic lock:\npublic void addName(String name) {\nsynchronized(this) {\nlastName = name;\nnameCount++;\n}\nnameList.add(name);\n}\n\nIn this example, the addName method needs to synchronize changes to lastName and nameCount, but also needs to avoid synchronizing invocations of other objects' methods. (Invoking other objects' methods from synchronized code can create problems that are described in the section on Liveness.) Without synchronized statements, there would have to be a separate, unsynchronized method for the sole purpose of invoking nameList.add.\nSynchronized statements are also useful for improving concurrency with fine-grained synchronization. Suppose, for example, class MsLunch has two instance fields, c1 and c2, that are never used together. All updates of these fields must be synchronized, but there's no reason to prevent an update of c1 from being interleaved with an update of c2 — and doing so reduces concurrency by creating unnecessary blocking. Instead of using synchronized methods or otherwise using the lock associated with this, we create two objects solely to provide locks.\npublic class MsLunch {\nprivate long c1 = 0;\nprivate long c2 = 0;\nprivate Object lock1 = new Object();\nprivate Object lock2 = new Object();\n\npublic void inc1() {\nsynchronized(lock1) {\nc1++;\n}\n}\n\npublic void inc2() {\nsynchronized(lock2) {\nc2++;\n}\n}\n}\n\nUse this idiom with extreme care. You must be absolutely sure that it really is safe to interleave access of the affected fields.\nReentrant Synchronization\nRecall that a thread cannot acquire a lock owned by another thread. But a thread can acquire a lock that it already owns. Allowing a thread to acquire the same lock more than once enables reentrant synchronization. This describes a situation where synchronized code, directly or indirectly, invokes a method that also contains synchronized code, and both sets of code use the same lock. Without reentrant synchronization, synchronized code would have to take many additional precautions to avoid having a thread cause itself to block.\n4.5 Atomic Access\nIn programming, an atomic action is one that effectively happens all at once. An atomic action cannot stop in the middle: it either happens completely, or it doesn't happen at all. No side effects of an atomic action are visible until the action is complete.\nWe have already seen that an increment expression, such as c++, does not describe an atomic action. Even very simple expressions can define complex actions that can decompose into other actions. However, there are actions you can specify that are atomic:\n\nReads and writes are atomic for reference variables and for most primitive variables (all types except long and double).\nReads and writes are atomic for all variables declared volatile (including long and double variables).\nAtomic actions cannot be interleaved, so they can be used without fear of thread interference. However, this does not eliminate all need to synchronize atomic actions, because memory consistency errors are still possible. Using volatile variables reduces the risk of memory consistency errors, because any write to a volatile variable establishes a happens-before relationship with subsequent reads of that same variable. This means that changes to a volatile variable are always visible to other threads. What's more, it also means that when a thread reads a volatile variable, it sees not just the latest change to the volatile, but also the side effects of the code that led up the change.\n\nUsing simple atomic variable access is more efficient than accessing these variables through synchronized code, but requires more care by the programmer to avoid memory consistency errors. Whether the extra effort is worthwhile depends on the size and complexity of the application.\nSome of the classes in the java.util.concurrent package provide atomic methods that do not rely on synchronization. We'll discuss them in the section on High Level Concurrency Objects.\n5. Liveness\n\nDeadlock\nStarvation and Livelock\n\n5.1 Deadlock\nWhen Deadlock runs, it's extremely likely that both threads will block when they attempt to invoke bowBack. Neither block will ever end, because each thread is waiting for the other to exit bow.\npublic class Deadlock {\nstatic class Friend {\nprivate final String name;\npublic Friend(String name) {\nthis.name = name;\n}\npublic String getName() {\nreturn this.name;\n}\npublic synchronized void bow(Friend bower) {\nSystem.out.format(\"%s: %s\"\n+ \" has bowed to me!%n\",\nthis.name, bower.getName());\nbower.bowBack(this);\n}\npublic synchronized void bowBack(Friend bower) {\nSystem.out.format(\"%s: %s\"\n+ \" has bowed back to me!%n\",\nthis.name, bower.getName());\n}\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\nfinal Friend alphonse = new Friend(\"Alphonse\");\nfinal Friend gaston = new Friend(\"Gaston\");\nnew Thread(new Runnable() {\npublic void run() { alphonse.bow(gaston); }\n}).start();\nnew Thread(new Runnable() {\npublic void run() { gaston.bow(alphonse); }\n}).start();\n}\n}\n\n5.2 Starvation and Livelock\n\nStarvation describes a situation where a thread is unable to gain regular access to shared resources and is unable to make progress. This happens when shared resources are made unavailable for long periods by \"greedy\" threads. For example, suppose an object provides a synchronized method that often takes a long time to return. If one thread invokes this method frequently, other threads that also need frequent synchronized access to the same object will often be blocked.\n\nLivelock: A thread often acts in response to the action of another thread. If the other thread's action is also a response to the action of another thread, then livelock may result. As with deadlock, livelocked threads are unable to make further progress. However, the threads are not blocked — they are simply too busy responding to each other to resume work. This is comparable to two people attempting to pass each other in a corridor: Alphonse moves to his left to let Gaston pass, while Gaston moves to his right to let Alphonse pass. Seeing that they are still blocking each other, Alphone moves to his right, while Gaston moves to his left. They're still blocking each other, so...\n\n\n6. Guarded Blocks\nThreads often have to coordinate their actions. The most common coordination idiom is the guarded block. Such a block begins by polling a condition that must be true before the block can proceed. There are a number of steps to follow in order to do this correctly.\nSuppose, for example guardedJoy is a method that must not proceed until a shared variable joy has been set by another thread. Such a method could, in theory, simply loop until the condition is satisfied, but that loop is wasteful, since it executes continuously while waiting.\npublic void guardedJoy() {\n// Simple loop guard. Wastes\n// processor time. Don't do this!\nwhile(!joy) {}\nSystem.out.println(\"Joy has been achieved!\");\n}\n\nA more efficient guard invokes Object.wait to suspend the current thread. The invocation of wait does not return until another thread has issued a notification that some special event may have occurred — though not necessarily the event this thread is waiting for:\npublic synchronized void guardedJoy() {\n// This guard only loops once for each special event, which may not\n// be the event we're waiting for.\nwhile(!joy) {\ntry {\nwait();\n} catch (InterruptedException e) {}\n}\nSystem.out.println(\"Joy and efficiency have been achieved!\");\n}\n\nNote: Always invoke wait inside a loop that tests for the condition being waited for. Don't assume that the interrupt was for the particular condition you were waiting for, or that the condition is still true.\nLike many methods that suspend execution, wait can throw InterruptedException. In this example, we can just ignore that exception — we only care about the value of joy.\nWhy is this version of guardedJoy synchronized? Suppose d is the object we're using to invoke wait. When a thread invokes d.wait, it must own the intrinsic lock for d — otherwise an error is thrown. Invoking wait inside a synchronized method is a simple way to acquire the intrinsic lock.\nWhen wait is invoked, the thread releases the lock and suspends execution. At some future time, another thread will acquire the same lock and invoke Object.notifyAll, informing all threads waiting on that lock that something important has happened:\npublic synchronized notifyJoy() {\njoy = true;\nnotifyAll();\n}\n\nSome time after the second thread has released the lock, the first thread reacquires the lock and resumes by returning from the invocation of wait.\nNote: There is a second notification method, notify, which wakes up a single thread. Because notify doesn't allow you to specify the thread that is woken up, it is useful only in massively parallel applications — that is, programs with a large number of threads, all doing similar chores. In such an application, you don't care which thread gets woken up.\nLet's use guarded blocks to create a Producer-Consumer application. This kind of application shares data between two threads: the producer, that creates the data, and the consumer, that does something with it. The two threads communicate using a shared object. Coordination is essential: the consumer thread must not attempt to retrieve the data before the producer thread has delivered it, and the producer thread must not attempt to deliver new data if the consumer hasn't retrieved the old data.\nIn this example, the data is a series of text messages, which are shared through an object of type Drop:\npublic class Drop {\n// Message sent from producer\n// to consumer.\nprivate String message;\n// True if consumer should wait\n// for producer to send message,\n// false if producer should wait for\n// consumer to retrieve message.\nprivate boolean empty = true;\n\npublic synchronized String take() {\n// Wait until message is\n// available.\nwhile (empty) {\ntry {\nwait();\n} catch (InterruptedException e) {}\n}\n// Toggle status.\nempty = true;\n// Notify producer that\n// status has changed.\nnotifyAll();\nreturn message;\n}\n\npublic synchronized void put(String message) {\n// Wait until message has\n// been retrieved.\nwhile (!empty) {\ntry {\nwait();\n} catch (InterruptedException e) {}\n}\n// Toggle status.\nempty = false;\n// Store message.\nthis.message = message;\n// Notify consumer that status\n// has changed.\nnotifyAll();\n}\n}\n\nThe producer thread, defined in Producer, sends a series of familiar messages. The string \"DONE\" indicates that all messages have been sent. To simulate the unpredictable nature of real-world applications, the producer thread pauses for random intervals between messages.\nimport java.util.Random;\n\npublic class Producer implements Runnable {\nprivate Drop drop;\n\npublic Producer(Drop drop) {\nthis.drop = drop;\n}\n\npublic void run() {\nString importantInfo[] = {\n\"Mares eat oats\",\n\"Does eat oats\",\n\"Little lambs eat ivy\",\n\"A kid will eat ivy too\"\n};\nRandom random = new Random();\n\nfor (int i = 0;\ni \nThe consumer thread, defined in Consumer, simply retrieves the messages and prints them out, until it retrieves the \"DONE\" string. This thread also pauses for random intervals.\nimport java.util.Random;\n\npublic class Consumer implements Runnable {\nprivate Drop drop;\n\npublic Consumer(Drop drop) {\nthis.drop = drop;\n}\n\npublic void run() {\nRandom random = new Random();\nfor (String message = drop.take();\n! message.equals(\"DONE\");\nmessage = drop.take()) {\nSystem.out.format(\"MESSAGE RECEIVED: %s%n\", message);\ntry {\nThread.sleep(random.nextInt(5000));\n} catch (InterruptedException e) {}\n}\n}\n}\n\nFinally, here is the main thread, defined in ProducerConsumerExample, that launches the producer and consumer threads.\npublic class ProducerConsumerExample {\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\nDrop drop = new Drop();\n(new Thread(new Producer(drop))).start();\n(new Thread(new Consumer(drop))).start();\n}\n}\n\nNote: The Drop class was written in order to demonstrate guarded blocks. To avoid re-inventing the wheel, examine the existing data structures in the Java Collections Framework before trying to code your own data-sharing objects. For more information, refer to the Questions and Exercises section.\n7. Immutable Objects\nAn object is considered immutable if its state cannot change after it is constructed. Maximum reliance on immutable objects is widely accepted as a sound strategy for creating simple, reliable code.\nImmutable objects are particularly useful in concurrent applications. Since they cannot change state, they cannot be corrupted by thread interference or observed in an inconsistent state.\nProgrammers are often reluctant to employ immutable objects, because they worry about the cost of creating a new object as opposed to updating an object in place. The impact of object creation is often overestimated, and can be offset by some of the efficiencies associated with immutable objects. These include decreased overhead due to garbage collection, and the elimination of code needed to protect mutable objects from corruption.\nThe following subsections take a class whose instances are mutable and derives a class with immutable instances from it. In so doing, they give general rules for this kind of conversion and demonstrate some of the advantages of immutable objects.\n7.1 A Synchronized Class Example\npublic class SynchronizedRGB {\n\n// Values must be between 0 and 255.\nprivate int red;\nprivate int green;\nprivate int blue;\nprivate String name;\n\nprivate void check(int red,int green,int blue) {\nif (red  255\n|| green  255\n|| blue  255) {\nthrow new IllegalArgumentException();\n}\n}\n\npublic SynchronizedRGB(int red,int green,int blue,String name) {\ncheck(red, green, blue);\nthis.red = red;\nthis.green = green;\nthis.blue = blue;\nthis.name = name;\n}\n\npublic void set(int red,int green,int blue, String name) {\ncheck(red, green, blue);\nsynchronized (this) {\nthis.red = red;\nthis.green = green;\nthis.blue = blue;\nthis.name = name;\n}\n}\n\npublic synchronized int getRGB() {\nreturn ((red \nSynchronizedRGB must be used carefully to avoid being seen in an inconsistent state. Suppose, for example, a thread executes the following code:\nSynchronizedRGB color = new SynchronizedRGB(0, 0, 0, \"Pitch Black\");\n...\nint myColorInt = color.getRGB(); //Statement 1\nString myColorName = color.getName(); //Statement 2\n\nIf another thread invokes color.set after Statement 1 but before Statement 2, the value of myColorInt won't match the value of myColorName. To avoid this outcome, the two statements must be bound together:\nsynchronized (color) {\nint myColorInt = color.getRGB();\nString myColorName = color.getName();\n}\n\nThis kind of inconsistency is only possible for mutable objects — it will not be an issue for the immutable version of SynchronizedRGB.\n7.2 A Strategy for Defining Immutable Objects\nThe following rules define a simple strategy for creating immutable objects. Not all classes documented as \"immutable\" follow these rules. This does not necessarily mean the creators of these classes were sloppy — they may have good reason for believing that instances of their classes never change after construction. However, such strategies require sophisticated analysis and are not for beginners.\n\nDon't provide \"setter\" methods — methods that modify fields or objects referred to by fields.\nMake all fields final and private.\nDon't allow subclasses to override methods. The simplest way to do this is to declare the class as final. A more sophisticated approach is to make the constructor private and construct instances in factory methods.\nIf the instance fields include references to mutable objects, don't allow those objects to be changed:\nDon't provide methods that modify the mutable objects.\nDon't share references to the mutable objects. Never store references to external, mutable objects passed to the constructor; if necessary, create copies, and store references to the copies. Similarly, create copies of your internal mutable objects when necessary to avoid returning the originals in your methods.\n\nApplying this strategy to SynchronizedRGB results in the following steps:\n\nThere are two setter methods in this class. The first one, set, arbitrarily transforms the object, and has no place in an immutable version of the class. The second one, invert, can be adapted by having it create a new object instead of modifying the existing one.\nAll fields are already private; they are further qualified as final.\nThe class itself is declared final.\nOnly one field refers to an object, and that object is itself immutable. Therefore, no safeguards against changing the state of \"contained\" mutable objects are necessary.\n\nfinal public class ImmutableRGB {\n\n// Values must be between 0 and 255.\nfinal private int red;\nfinal private int green;\nfinal private int blue;\nfinal private String name;\n\nprivate void check(int red,int green,int blue) {\nif (red  255\n|| green  255\n|| blue  255) {\nthrow new IllegalArgumentException();\n}\n}\n\npublic ImmutableRGB(int red,int green,int blue,String name) {\ncheck(red, green, blue);\nthis.red = red;\nthis.green = green;\nthis.blue = blue;\nthis.name = name;\n}\n\npublic int getRGB() {\nreturn ((red \n8. High Level Concurrency Objects\nMost of these features are implemented in the new java.util.concurrent packages. There are also new concurrent data structures in the Java Collections Framework.\n\nLock objects: support locking idioms that simplify many concurrent applications.\nExecutors:  define a high-level API for launching and managing threads.\nConcurrent collections:  make it easier to manage large collections of data, and can greatly reduce the need for synchronization.\nAtomic variables:  have features that minimize synchronization and help avoid memory consistency errors.\nThreadLocalRandom (in JDK 7) provides efficient generation of pseudorandom numbers from multiple threads.\n\n8.1 Lock Objects\nSynchronized code relies on a simple kind of reentrant lock. This kind of lock is easy to use, but has many limitations. More sophisticated locking idioms are supported by the java.util.concurrent.locks package.\nLock objects work very much like the implicit locks used by synchronized code. As with implicit locks, only one thread can own a Lock object at a time. Lock objects also support a wait/notify mechanism, through their associated Condition objects.\nThe biggest advantage of Lock objects over implicit locks is their ability to back out of an attempt to acquire a lock. The tryLock method backs out if the lock is not available immediately or before a timeout expires (if specified). The lockInterruptibly method backs out if another thread sends an interrupt before the lock is acquired.\nLet's use Lock objects to solve the deadlock problem we saw in Liveness. Alphonse and Gaston have trained themselves to notice when a friend is about to bow. We model this improvement by requiring that our Friend objects must acquire locks for both participants before proceeding with the bow. Here is the source code for the improved model, Safelock. To demonstrate the versatility of this idiom, we assume that Alphonse and Gaston are so infatuated with their newfound ability to bow safely that they can't stop bowing to each other:\nimport java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;\nimport java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;\nimport java.util.Random;\n\npublic class Safelock {\nstatic class Friend {\nprivate final String name;\nprivate final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();\n\npublic Friend(String name) {\nthis.name = name;\n}\n\npublic String getName() {\nreturn this.name;\n}\n\npublic boolean impendingBow(Friend bower) {\nBoolean myLock = false;\nBoolean yourLock = false;\ntry {\nmyLock = lock.tryLock();\nyourLock = bower.lock.tryLock();\n} finally {\nif (! (myLock && yourLock)) {\nif (myLock) {\nlock.unlock();\n}\nif (yourLock) {\nbower.lock.unlock();\n}\n}\n}\nreturn myLock && yourLock;\n}\npublic void bow(Friend bower) {\nif (impendingBow(bower)) {\ntry {\nSystem.out.format(\"%s: %s has\"\n+ \" bowed to me!%n\",\nthis.name, bower.getName());\nbower.bowBack(this);\n} finally {\nlock.unlock();\nbower.lock.unlock();\n}\n} else {\nSystem.out.format(\"%s: %s started\"\n+ \" to bow to me, but saw that\"\n+ \" I was already bowing to\"\n+ \" him.%n\",\nthis.name, bower.getName());\n}\n}\n\npublic void bowBack(Friend bower) {\nSystem.out.format(\"%s: %s has\" +\n\" bowed back to me!%n\",\nthis.name, bower.getName());\n}\n}\n\nstatic class BowLoop implements Runnable {\nprivate Friend bower;\nprivate Friend bowee;\n\npublic BowLoop(Friend bower, Friend bowee) {\nthis.bower = bower;\nthis.bowee = bowee;\n}\npublic void run() {\nRandom random = new Random();\nfor (;;) {\ntry {\nThread.sleep(random.nextInt(10));\n} catch (InterruptedException e) {}\nbowee.bow(bower);\n}\n}\n}\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\nfinal Friend alphonse = new Friend(\"Alphonse\");\nfinal Friend gaston = new Friend(\"Gaston\");\nnew Thread(new BowLoop(alphonse, gaston)).start();\nnew Thread(new BowLoop(gaston, alphonse)).start();\n}\n}\n\n8.2 Executors\nIn all of the previous examples, there's a close connection between the task being done by a new thread, as defined by its Runnable object, and the thread itself, as defined by a Thread object. This works well for small applications, but in large-scale applications, it makes sense to separate thread management and creation from the rest of the application. Objects that encapsulate these functions are known as executors. The following subsections describe executors in detail.\n\nExecutor Interfaces define the three executor object types.\nThread Pools are the most common kind of executor implementation.\nFork/Join is a framework (new in JDK 7) for taking advantage of multiple processors.\n\n8.2.1 Executor Interfaces\nThe java.util.concurrent package defines three executor interfaces:\nExecutor, a simple interface that supports launching new tasks.\nExecutorService, a subinterface of Executor, which adds features that help manage the lifecycle, both of the individual tasks and of the executor itself.\nScheduledExecutorService, a subinterface of ExecutorService, supports future and/or periodic execution of tasks.\nTypically, variables that refer to executor objects are declared as one of these three interface types, not with an executor class type.\nThe Executor Interface\nThe Executor interface provides a single method, execute, designed to be a drop-in replacement for a common thread-creation idiom. If r is a Runnable object, and e is an Executor object you can replace\n(new Thread(r)).start();\nwith\ne.execute(r);\nHowever, the definition of execute is less specific. The low-level idiom creates a new thread and launches it immediately. Depending on the Executor implementation, execute may do the same thing, but is more likely to use an existing worker thread to run r, or to place r in a queue to wait for a worker thread to become available. (We'll describe worker threads in the section on Thread Pools.)\nThe executor implementations in java.util.concurrent are designed to make full use of the more advanced ExecutorService and ScheduledExecutorService interfaces, although they also work with the base Executor interface.\nThe ExecutorService Interface\nThe ExecutorService interface supplements execute with a similar, but more versatile submit method. Like execute, submit accepts Runnable objects, but also accepts Callable objects, which allow the task to return a value. The submit method returns a Future object, which is used to retrieve the Callable return value and to manage the status of both Callable and Runnable tasks.\nExecutorService also provides methods for submitting large collections of Callable objects. Finally, ExecutorService provides a number of methods for managing the shutdown of the executor. To support immediate shutdown, tasks should handle interrupts correctly.\nThe ScheduledExecutorService Interface\nThe ScheduledExecutorService interface supplements the methods of its parent ExecutorService with schedule, which executes a Runnable or Callable task after a specified delay. In addition, the interface defines scheduleAtFixedRate and scheduleWithFixedDelay, which executes specified tasks repeatedly, at defined intervals.\n8.2.2 Thread Pools\nMost of the executor implementations in java.util.concurrent use thread pools, which consist of worker threads. This kind of thread exists separately from the Runnable and Callable tasks it executes and is often used to execute multiple tasks.\nUsing worker threads minimizes the overhead due to thread creation. Thread objects use a significant amount of memory, and in a large-scale application, allocating and deallocating many thread objects creates a significant memory management overhead.\nOne common type of thread pool is the fixed thread pool. This type of pool always has a specified number of threads running; if a thread is somehow terminated while it is still in use, it is automatically replaced with a new thread. Tasks are submitted to the pool via an internal queue, which holds extra tasks whenever there are more active tasks than threads.\nAn important advantage of the fixed thread pool is that applications using it degrade gracefully. To understand this, consider a web server application where each HTTP request is handled by a separate thread. If the application simply creates a new thread for every new HTTP request, and the system receives more requests than it can handle immediately, the application will suddenly stop responding to all requests when the overhead of all those threads exceed the capacity of the system. With a limit on the number of the threads that can be created, the application will not be servicing HTTP requests as quickly as they come in, but it will be servicing them as quickly as the system can sustain.\nA simple way to create an executor that uses a fixed thread pool is to invoke the newFixedThreadPool factory method in java.util.concurrent.Executors This class also provides the following factory methods:\nThe newCachedThreadPool method creates an executor with an expandable thread pool. This executor is suitable for applications that launch many short-lived tasks.\nThe newSingleThreadExecutor method creates an executor that executes a single task at a time.\nSeveral factory methods are ScheduledExecutorService versions of the above executors.\nIf none of the executors provided by the above factory methods meet your needs, constructing instances of java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor or java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor will give you additional options.\n8.2.3 Fork/Join\nThe fork/join framework is an implementation of the ExecutorService interface that helps you take advantage of multiple processors. It is designed for work that can be broken into smaller pieces recursively. The goal is to use all the available processing power to enhance the performance of your application.\nAs with any ExecutorService implementation, the fork/join framework distributes tasks to worker threads in a thread pool. The fork/join framework is distinct because it uses a work-stealing algorithm. Worker threads that run out of things to do can steal tasks from other threads that are still busy.\nThe center of the fork/join framework is the ForkJoinPool class, an extension of the AbstractExecutorService class. ForkJoinPool implements the core work-stealing algorithm and can execute ForkJoinTask processes.\nBasic Use\nThe first step for using the fork/join framework is to write code that performs a segment of the work. Your code should look similar to the following pseudocode:\nif (my portion of the work is small enough)\ndo the work directly\nelse\nsplit my work into two pieces\ninvoke the two pieces and wait for the results\nWrap this code in a ForkJoinTask subclass, typically using one of its more specialized types, either RecursiveTask (which can return a result) or RecursiveAction.\nAfter your ForkJoinTask subclass is ready, create the object that represents all the work to be done and pass it to the invoke() method of a ForkJoinPool instance.\nBlurring for Clarity\nTo help you understand how the fork/join framework works, consider the following example. Suppose that you want to blur an image. The original source image is represented by an array of integers, where each integer contains the color values for a single pixel. The blurred destination image is also represented by an integer array with the same size as the source.\nPerforming the blur is accomplished by working through the source array one pixel at a time. Each pixel is averaged with its surrounding pixels (the red, green, and blue components are averaged), and the result is placed in the destination array. Since an image is a large array, this process can take a long time. You can take advantage of concurrent processing on multiprocessor systems by implementing the algorithm using the fork/join framework. Here is one possible implementation:\npublic class ForkBlur extends RecursiveAction {\nprivate int[] mSource;\nprivate int mStart;\nprivate int mLength;\nprivate int[] mDestination;\n// Processing window size; should be odd.\nprivate int mBlurWidth = 15;\npublic ForkBlur(int[] src, int start, int length, int[] dst) {\nmSource = src;\nmStart = start;\nmLength = length;\nmDestination = dst;\n}\nprotected void computeDirectly() {\nint sidePixels = (mBlurWidth - 1) / 2;\nfor (int index = mStart; index > 16)\n/ mBlurWidth;\ngt += (float)((pixel & 0x0000ff00) >> 8)\n/ mBlurWidth;\nbt += (float)((pixel & 0x000000ff) >> 0)\n/ mBlurWidth;\n}\n// Reassemble destination pixel.\nint dpixel = (0xff000000 ) |\n(((int)rt) \nprotected static int sThreshold = 100000;\nprotected void compute() {\nif (mLength \nCreate a task that represents all of the work to be done.\n// source image pixels are in src\n// destination image pixels are in dst\nForkBlur fb = new ForkBlur(src, 0, src.length, dst);\nCreate the ForkJoinPool that will run the task.\nForkJoinPool pool = new ForkJoinPool();\nRun the task.\npool.invoke(fb);\nFor the full source code, including some extra code that creates the destination image file, see the ForkBlur example.\nStandard Implementations\nBesides using the fork/join framework to implement custom algorithms for tasks to be performed concurrently on a multiprocessor system (such as the ForkBlur.java example in the previous section), there are some generally useful features in Java SE which are already implemented using the fork/join framework. One such implementation, introduced in Java SE 8, is used by the java.util.Arrays class for its parallelSort() methods. These methods are similar to sort(), but leverage concurrency via the fork/join framework. Parallel sorting of large arrays is faster than sequential sorting when run on multiprocessor systems. However, how exactly the fork/join framework is leveraged by these methods is outside the scope of the Java Tutorials. For this information, see the Java API documentation.\nAnother implementation of the fork/join framework is used by methods in the java.util.streams package, which is part of Project Lambda scheduled for the Java SE 8 release. For more information, see the Lambda Expressions section.\n8.3 Concurrent Collections\nThe java.util.concurrent package includes a number of additions to the Java Collections Framework. These are most easily categorized by the collection interfaces provided:\nBlockingQueue defines a first-in-first-out data structure that blocks or times out when you attempt to add to a full queue, or retrieve from an empty queue.\nConcurrentMap is a subinterface of java.util.Map that defines useful atomic operations. These operations remove or replace a key-value pair only if the key is present, or add a key-value pair only if the key is absent. Making these operations atomic helps avoid synchronization. The standard general-purpose implementation of ConcurrentMap is ConcurrentHashMap, which is a concurrent analog of HashMap.\nConcurrentNavigableMap is a subinterface of ConcurrentMap that supports approximate matches. The standard general-purpose implementation of ConcurrentNavigableMap is ConcurrentSkipListMap, which is a concurrent analog of TreeMap.\nAll of these collections help avoid Memory Consistency Errors by defining a happens-before relationship between an operation that adds an object to the collection with subsequent operations that access or remove that object.\n8.4 Atomic Variables\nThe java.util.concurrent.atomic package defines classes that support atomic operations on single variables. All classes have get and set methods that work like reads and writes on volatile variables. That is, a set has a happens-before relationship with any subsequent get on the same variable. The atomic compareAndSet method also has these memory consistency features, as do the simple atomic arithmetic methods that apply to integer atomic variables.\nTo see how this package might be used, let's return to the Counter class we originally used to demonstrate thread interference:\nclass Counter {\nprivate int c = 0;\npublic void increment() {\nc++;\n}\npublic void decrement() {\nc--;\n}\npublic int value() {\nreturn c;\n}\n}\nOne way to make Counter safe from thread interference is to make its methods synchronized, as in SynchronizedCounter:\nclass SynchronizedCounter {\nprivate int c = 0;\npublic synchronized void increment() {\nc++;\n}\npublic synchronized void decrement() {\nc--;\n}\npublic synchronized int value() {\nreturn c;\n}\n}\nFor this simple class, synchronization is an acceptable solution. But for a more complicated class, we might want to avoid the liveness impact of unnecessary synchronization. Replacing the int field with an AtomicInteger allows us to prevent thread interference without resorting to synchronization, as in AtomicCounter:\nimport java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;\nclass AtomicCounter {\nprivate AtomicInteger c = new AtomicInteger(0);\npublic void increment() {\nc.incrementAndGet();\n}\npublic void decrement() {\nc.decrementAndGet();\n}\npublic int value() {\nreturn c.get();\n}\n}\n8.5 Concurrent Random Numbers\nIn JDK 7, java.util.concurrent includes a convenience class, ThreadLocalRandom, for applications that expect to use random numbers from multiple threads or ForkJoinTasks.\nFor concurrent access, using ThreadLocalRandom instead of Math.random() results in less contention and, ultimately, better performance.\nAll you need to do is call ThreadLocalRandom.current(), then call one of its methods to retrieve a random number. Here is one example:\nint r = ThreadLocalRandom.current() .nextInt(4, 77);\nSynchronization Questions\nQ: What is synchronization and why is it important? \nA: With respect to multithreading, synchronization is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to shared resources. Without synchronization, it is possible for one thread to modify a shared object while another thread is in the process of using or updating that object's value. This often leads to significant errors.\nQ: What are synchronized methods and synchronized statements? \n1): Synchronized methods are methods that are used to control access to an object. A thread only executes a synchronized method after it has acquired the lock for the method's object or class.\n\n2): Synchronized statements are similar to synchronized methods. A synchronized statement can only be executed after a thread has acquired the lock for the object or class referenced in the synchronized statement.\nQ: When a thread is created and started, what is its initial state? \nA: A thread is in the ready state after it has been created and started.\nQ: What is daemon thread and which method is used to create the daemon thread?\nA: Daemon thread is a low priority thread which runs intermittently in the back ground doing the garbage collection operation for the java runtime system.\n\nsetDaemon method is used to create a daemon thread.\nQ: What method must be implemented by all threads? \nA: run() method. Whether they\n1) extends Thread\n2) implements Runnable // this way is preferable. It can extend other class.\nMore Questions\nQ: How does Java handle integer overflows and underflows? \nA: It uses those low order bytes of the result that can fit into the size of the type allowed by the operation.\nQ: Does garbage collection guarantee that a program will not run out of memory?\nA: No.\n1) It is possible for programs to use up memory resources faster than they are garbage collected.\n2) It is also possible for programs to create objects that are not subject to garbage collection\nQ: What is the difference between preemptive scheduling and time slicing? \n1) Under preemptive scheduling, the highest priority task executes until it enters the waiting or dead states or a higher priority task comes into existence.\n\n2) Under time slicing, a task executes for a predefined slice of time and then reenters the pool of ready tasks. The scheduler then determines which task should execute next, based on priority and other factors.\nQ: What is the purpose of finalization? \nA: It is to give an unreachable object the opportunity to perform any cleanup processing before the object is garbage collected.\nQ: What is the difference between processes and threads? \n1) A process is an execution of a program\n2) A thread is a single execution sequence within the process.\n3) A process can contain multiple threads.\n4) A thread is sometimes called a lightweight process.\nQ: Briefly explain high-level thread states? \nThe state chart diagram below describes the thread states.\n\n1) Runnable — A thread becomes runnable when you call the start( ), but does not necessarily start running immediately. It will be pooled waiting for its turn to be picked for execution by the thread scheduler based on thread priorities.\n\n2) Running: The processor is actively executing the thread code. It runs until it becomes blocked, or voluntarily gives up its turn with this static method Thread.yield( ). Because of context switching overhead, yield( ) should not be used very frequently\n\n3) Waiting:\na. setup time is optional.\nb. release both execution right and lock\nc. Needs notify() to wake up.\nA thread is in a blocked state while it waits for some external processing\nsuch as file I/O to finish.A call to currObject.wait( ) method causes the\ncurrent thread to wait until some other thread invokescurrObject.notify( )\nor the currObject.notifyAll( ) is executed.\n\n4) Sleeping:\na. setup tiem is required.\nb. release execution right, but not lock.\nJava threads are forcibly put to sleep (suspended) with this overloaded method:\nThread.sleep(milliseconds), Thread.sleep(milliseconds, nanoseconds);\n\n4) Blocked on I/O: Will move to runnable after I/O condition like reading bytes of data etc changes.\n\n5) Blocked on synchronization: will move to running when a lock is acquired.\n\n6) Dead: The thread is finished working.\nQ. What is the difference between yield and sleeping? \n1). When a task invokes yield( ), it changes from running state to runnable state.\n**Sleep** causes thread to suspend itself for x milliseconds\n**Yield** suspends the thread and immediately moves it to the ready queue (the queue which the CPU uses to run threads).\n2) When a task invokes sleep ( ), it changes from running state to waiting/sleeping state.\n3) The method wait(1000) causes the current thread to wait up to one second a signal from other threads. A thread could wait less than 1 second if it receives the notify( ) or notifyAll( ) method call.\n4) The call to sleep(1000) causes the current thread to sleep for t least 1 second.\nJava Concurrency Interview Questions\nQ.What is atomic operation? What are atomic classes in Java Concurrency API? \n1) Atomic operations are performed in a single unit of task without interference from other operations.\n\n2) Atomic operations are necessity in multi-threaded environment to avoid data inconsistency.\n\n3) For example int++ is not an atomic operation. So by the time one threads read it’s value and increment it by one, other thread has read the older value leading to wrong result.\n\n4) To solve this issue, we will have to make sure that increment operation on count is atomic, we can do that using Synchronization but Java 5 java.util.concurrent.atomic provides wrapper classes for int and long that can be used to achieve this atomically without usage of Synchronization.\nQ.What is Lock interface in Java Concurrency API? What are it’s benefits over synchronization?\n1) Lock interface provide more extensive locking operations than can be obtained using synchronized methods and statements.\n\n2) They allow more flexible structuring, may have quite different properties, and may support multiple associated Condition objects.\n\n3) The advantages of a lock are:\n**it’s possible to make them fair\n**it’s possible to make a thread responsive to interruption while waiting on a Lock object.\n**it’s possible to try to acquire the lock, but return immediately or after a timeout if the lock can’t be acquired\n**it’s possible to acquire and release locks in different scopes, and in different orders\nQ.What is Executors Framework?\n1) The Executor framework is a framework for standardizing invocation, scheduling, execution, and control of asynchronous tasks according to a set of execution policies.\n\n2) Creating a lot many threads with no bounds to the maximum threshold can cause application to run out of heap memory. So, creating a ThreadPool is a better solution as a finite number of threads can be pooled and reused.\n\n3) Executors framework facilitate process of creating Thread pools in java.\nQ.What is BlockingQueue? How can we implement Producer-Consumer problem using Blocking Queue? \n1) BlockingQueue is a Queue that supports operations that wait for the queue to become non-empty when retrieving and removing an element, and wait for space to become available in the queue when adding an element.\n\n2) BlockingQueue doesn’t accept null values and throw NullPointerException if you try to store null value in the queue.\n\n3) BlockingQueue implementations are thread-safe. All queuing methods are atomic in nature and use internal locks or other forms of concurrency control.\n\n4) BlockingQueue interface is part of java collections framework and it’s primarily used for implementing producer consumer problem.\nQ.What is Callable and Future?\n1) Callable interface in concurrency package that is similar to Runnable interface but it can return any Object and able to throw Exception.\n\n2) Callable interface use Generic to define the return type of Object. Executors class provide useful methods to execute Callable in a thread pool.\n\n3) Since callable tasks run in parallel, we have to wait for the returned Object.\n\n4) Callable tasks return java.util.concurrent.Future object. Using Future we can find out the status of the Callable task and get the returned Object.\n\n5) It provides get() method that can wait for the Callable to finish and then return the result.\nQ.What is FutureTask Class? \n1) FutureTask is the base implementation class of Future interface and we can use it with Executors for asynchronous processing.\n\n2) Most of the time we don’t need to use FutureTask class but it comes real handy if we want to override some of the methods of Future interface and want to keep most of the base implementation. We can just extend this class and override the methods according to our requirements.\nQ.What are Concurrent Collection Classes? \n1) Java Collection classes are fail-fast which means that if the Collection will be changed while some thread is traversing over it using iterator, the iterator.next() will throw ConcurrentModificationException.\n\n2) Concurrent Collection classes support full concurrency of retrievals and adjustable expected concurrency for updates. Major classes are ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList and CopyOnWriteArraySet\nQ.What is Executors Class? \n1) Executors class provide utility methods for Executor, ExecutorService, ScheduledExecutorService, ThreadFactory, and Callable classes.\n\n2) Executors class can be used to easily create Thread Pool in java, also this is the only class supporting execution of Callable implementations.\n"},"java-quick-review/chapter09_jdbc.html":{"url":"java-quick-review/chapter09_jdbc.html","title":"JDBC","keywords":"","body":"#\nJDBC: Java Database Conncetion\n1. Processing SQL Statements with JDBC\nIn general, to process any SQL statement with JDBC, you follow these steps:\n\nEstablishing a connection.\nCreate a statement.\nExecute the query.\nProcess the ResultSet object.\nClose the connection.\nThis page uses the following method, CoffeesTables.viewTable, from the tutorial sample to demonstrate these steps. This method outputs the contents of the table COFFEES. This method will be discussed in more detail later in this tutorial:\n\npublic static void viewTable(Connection con, String dbName) throws SQLException {\nStatement stmt = null;\nString query = \"select COF_NAME, SUP_ID, PRICE, \" +\n\"SALES, TOTAL \" +\n\"from \" + dbName + \".COFFEES\";\ntry {\nstmt = con.createStatement();\nResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query);\nwhile (rs.next()) {\nString coffeeName = rs.getString(\"COF_NAME\");\nint supplierID = rs.getInt(\"SUP_ID\");\nfloat price = rs.getFloat(\"PRICE\");\nint sales = rs.getInt(\"SALES\");\nint total = rs.getInt(\"TOTAL\");\nSystem.out.println(coffeeName + \"\\t\" + supplierID +\n\"\\t\" + price + \"\\t\" + sales +\n\"\\t\" + total);\n}\n} catch (SQLException e ) {\nJDBCTutorialUtilities.printSQLException(e);\n} finally {\nif (stmt != null) { stmt.close(); }\n}\n}\n\nEstablishing Connections\nFirst, establish a connection with the data source you want to use. A data source can be a DBMS, a legacy file system, or some other source of data with a corresponding JDBC driver. This connection is represented by a Connection object.\npublic Connection getConnection() throws SQLException {\nConnection conn = null;\nProperties connectionProps = new Properties();\nconnectionProps.put(\"user\", this.userName);\nconnectionProps.put(\"password\", this.password);\n\nif (this.dbms.equals(\"mysql\")) {\nconn = DriverManager.getConnection(\n\"jdbc:\" + this.dbms + \"://\" +\nthis.serverName +\n\":\" + this.portNumber + \"/\",\nconnectionProps);\n} else if (this.dbms.equals(\"derby\")) {\nconn = DriverManager.getConnection(\n\"jdbc:\" + this.dbms + \":\" +\nthis.dbName +\n\";create=true\",\nconnectionProps);\n}\nSystem.out.println(\"Connected to database\");\nreturn conn;\n}\n\nCreating Statements\nA Statement is an interface that represents a SQL statement. You execute Statement objects, and they generate ResultSet objects, which is a table of data representing a database result set. You need a Connection object to create a Statement object.\nFor example, CoffeesTables.viewTable creates a Statement object with the following code:\nstmt = con.createStatement();\n\nThere are three different kinds of statements:\n\nStatement: Used to implement simple SQL statements with no parameters.\nPreparedStatement: (Extends Statement.) Used for precompiling SQL statements that might contain input parameters.\nCallableStatement: (Extends PreparedStatement.) Used to execute stored procedures that may contain both input and output parameters.\nExecuting Queries\nTo execute a query, call an execute method from Statement such as the following:\nexecute: Returns true if the first object that the query returns is a ResultSet object. Use this method if the query could return one or more ResultSet objects. Retrieve the ResultSet objects returned from the query by repeatedly calling Statement.getResultSet.\nexecuteQuery: Returns one ResultSet object.\nexecuteUpdate: Returns an integer representing the number of rows affected by the SQL statement. Use this method if you are using INSERT, DELETE, or UPDATE SQL statements.\n\nFor example, CoffeesTables.viewTable executed a Statement object with the following code:\nResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query);\n\nProcessing ResultSet Objects\nYou access the data in a ResultSet object through a cursor. Note that this cursor is not a database cursor. This cursor is a pointer that points to one row of data in the ResultSet object. Initially, the cursor is positioned before the first row. You call various methods defined in the ResultSet object to move the cursor.\nFor example, CoffeesTables.viewTable repeatedly calls the method ResultSet.next to move the cursor forward by one row. Every time it calls next, the method outputs the data in the row where the cursor is currently positioned:\ntry {\nstmt = con.createStatement();\nResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query);\nwhile (rs.next()) {\nString coffeeName = rs.getString(\"COF_NAME\");\nint supplierID = rs.getInt(\"SUP_ID\");\nfloat price = rs.getFloat(\"PRICE\");\nint sales = rs.getInt(\"SALES\");\nint total = rs.getInt(\"TOTAL\");\nSystem.out.println(coffeeName + \"\\t\" + supplierID +\n\"\\t\" + price + \"\\t\" + sales +\n\"\\t\" + total);\n}\n}\n\nClosing Connections\nWhen you are finished using a Statement, call the method Statement.close to immediately release the resources it is using. When you call this method, its ResultSet objects are closed.\nFor example, the method CoffeesTables.viewTable ensures that the Statement object is closed at the end of the method, regardless of any SQLException objects thrown, by wrapping it in a finally block:\n} finally {\nif (stmt != null) { stmt.close(); }\n}\n\nJDBC throws an SQLException when it encounters an error during an interaction with a data source. See Handling SQL Exceptions for more information.\nIn JDBC 4.1, which is available in Java SE release 7 and later, you can use a try-with-resources statement to automatically close Connection, Statement, and ResultSet objects, regardless of whether an SQLException has been thrown. An automatic resource statement consists of a try statement and one or more declared resources. For example, you can modify CoffeesTables.viewTable so that its Statement object closes automatically, as follows:\npublic static void viewTable(Connection con) throws SQLException {\n\nString query = \"select COF_NAME, SUP_ID, PRICE, \" +\n\"SALES, TOTAL \" +\n\"from COFFEES\";\n\ntry (Statement stmt = con.createStatement()) {\n\nResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query);\n\nwhile (rs.next()) {\nString coffeeName = rs.getString(\"COF_NAME\");\nint supplierID = rs.getInt(\"SUP_ID\");\nfloat price = rs.getFloat(\"PRICE\");\nint sales = rs.getInt(\"SALES\");\nint total = rs.getInt(\"TOTAL\");\nSystem.out.println(coffeeName + \", \" + supplierID +\n\", \" + price + \", \" + sales +\n\", \" + total);\n}\n} catch (SQLException e) {\nJDBCTutorialUtilities.printSQLException(e);\n}\n}\n\nThe following statement is an try-with-resources statement, which declares one resource, stmt, that will be automatically closed when the try block terminates:\ntry (Statement stmt = con.createStatement()) {\n// ...\n}\n\n"},"java-quick-review/chapter10_lambda-expressions.html":{"url":"java-quick-review/chapter10_lambda-expressions.html","title":"Lambda","keywords":"","body":"#\nLambda Expressions\n\nIdeal Use Case for Lambda Expressions\nApproach 1: Create Methods That Search for Members That Match One Characteristic\nApproach 2: Create More Generalized Search Methods\nApproach 3: Specify Search Criteria Code in a Local Class\nApproach 4: Specify Search Criteria Code in an Anonymous Class\nApproach 5: Specify Search Criteria Code with a Lambda Expression\nApproach 6: Use Standard Functional Interfaces with Lambda Expressions\nApproach 7: Use Lambda Expressions Throughout Your Application\nApproach 8: Use Generics More Extensively\nApproach 9: Use Aggregate Operations That Accept Lambda Expressions as Parameters\n\n\nLambda Expressions in GUI Applications\nSyntax of Lambda Expressions\nAccessing Local Variables of the Enclosing Scope\nTarget Typing\nTarget Types and Method Arguments\nSerialization\n\n1.

What if you decide to change the Person class and add other attributes such as relationship status or geographical location? Although this method is more generic than printPersonsOlderThan, trying to create a separate method for each possible search query can still lead to brittle code. You can instead separate the code that specifies the criteria for which you want to search in a different class.\n1.3 Approach 3: Specify Search Criteria Code in a Local Class\nThe following method prints members that match search criteria that you specify:\npublic static void printPersons(\nList roster, CheckPerson tester) {\nfor (Person p : roster) {\nif (tester.test(p)) {\np.printPerson();\n}\n}\n}\n\nThis method checks each Person instance contained in the List parameter roster whether it satisfies the search criteria specified in the CheckPerson parameter tester by invoking the method tester.test. If the method tester.test returns a true value, then the method printPersons is invoked on the Person instance.\nTo specify the search criteria, you implement the CheckPerson interface:\ninterface CheckPerson {\nboolean test(Person p);\n}\n\nThe following class implements the CheckPerson interface by specifying an implementation for the method test. This method filters members that are eligible for Selective Service in the United States: it returns a true value if its Person parameter is male and between the ages of 18 and 25:\nclass CheckPersonEligibleForSelectiveService implements CheckPerson {\npublic boolean test(Person p) {\nreturn p.gender == Person.Sex.MALE &&\np.getAge() >= 18 &&\np.getAge() \nTo use this class, you create a new instance of it and invoke the printPersons method:\nprintPersons(roster, new CheckPersonEligibleForSelectiveService());\n\nAlthough this approach is less brittle—you don't have to rewrite methods if you change the structure of the Person—you still have additional code: a new interface and a local class for each search you plan to perform in your application. Because CheckPersonEligibleForSelectiveService implements an interface, you can use an anonymous class instead of a local class and bypass the need to declare a new class for each search.\n1.4 Approach 4: Specify Search Criteria Code in an Anonymous Class\nOne of the arguments of the following invocation of the method printPersons is an anonymous class that filters members that are eligible for Selective Service in the United States: those who are male and between the ages of 18 and 25:\nprintPersons(\nroster,\nnew CheckPerson() {\npublic boolean test(Person p) {\nreturn p.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE\n&& p.getAge() >= 18\n&& p.getAge() \nThis approach reduces the amount of code required because you don't have to create a new class for each search that you want to perform. However, the syntax of anonymous classes is bulky considering that the CheckPerson interface contains only one method. In this case, you can use a lambda expression instead of an anonymous class, as described in the next section.\n1.5 Approach 5: Specify Search Criteria Code with a Lambda Expression\nThe CheckPerson interface is a functional interface. A functional interface is any interface that contains only one abstract method. (A functional interface may contain one or more default methods or static methods.) Because a functional interface contains only one abstract method, you can omit the name of that method when you implement it. To do this, instead of using an anonymous class expression, you use a lambda expression, which is highlighted in the following method invocation:\nprintPersons(\nroster,\n(Person p) -> p.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE\n&& p.getAge() >= 18\n&& p.getAge() \nYou can use a standard functional interface in place of the interface CheckPerson, which reduces even further the amount of code required.\n1.6 Approach 6: Use Standard Functional Interfaces with Lambda Expressions\nReconsider the CheckPerson interface:\ninterface CheckPerson {\nboolean test(Person p);\n}\n\nThis is a very simple interface. It's a functional interface because it contains only one abstract method. This method takes one parameter and returns a boolean value. The method is so simple that it might not be worth it to define one in your application. Consequently, the JDK defines several standard functional interfaces, which you can find in the package java.util.function.\nFor example, you can use the Predicate interface in place of CheckPerson. This interface contains the method boolean test(T t):\ninterface Predicate {\nboolean test(T t);\n}\n\nThe interface Predicate is an example of a generic interface. Generic types (such as generic interfaces) specify one or more type parameters within angle brackets (<>). This interface contains only one type parameter, T. When you declare or instantiate a generic type with actual type arguments, you have a parameterized type. For example, the parameterized type Predicate is the following:\ninterface Predicate {\nboolean test(Person t);\n}\n\nThis parameterized type contains a method that has the same return type and parameters as CheckPerson.boolean test(Person p). Consequently, you can use Predicate in place of CheckPerson as the following method demonstrates:\npublic static void printPersonsWithPredicate(\nList roster, Predicate tester) {\nfor (Person p : roster) {\nif (tester.test(p)) {\np.printPerson();\n}\n}\n}\n\nAs a result, the following method invocation is the same as when you invoked printPersons in Approach 3: Specify Search Criteria Code in a Local Class to obtain members who are eligible for Selective Service:\nprintPersonsWithPredicate(\nroster,\np -> p.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE\n&& p.getAge() >= 18\n&& p.getAge() \nThis is not the only possible place in this method to use a lambda expression. The following approach suggests other ways to use lambda expressions.\n1.7 Approach 7: Use Lambda Expressions Throughout Your Application\npublic static void printPersonsWithPredicate(\nList roster, Predicate tester) {\nfor (Person p : roster) {\nif (tester.test(p)) {\np.printPerson();\n}\n}\n}\n\nThis method checks each Person instance contained in the List parameter roster whether it satisfies the criteria specified in the Predicate parameter tester. If the Person instance does satisfy the criteria specified by tester, the method printPersron is invoked on the Person instance.\nInstead of invoking the method printPerson, you can specify a different action to perform on those Person instances that satisfy the criteria specified by tester. You can specify this action with a lambda expression. Suppose you want a lambda expression similar to printPerson, one that takes one argument (an object of type Person) and returns void. Remember, to use a lambda expression, you need to implement a functional interface. In this case, you need a functional interface that contains an abstract method that can take one argument of type Person and returns void. The Consumer interface contains the method void accept(T t), which has these characteristics. The following method replaces the invocation p.printPerson() with an instance of Consumer that invokes the method accept:\npublic static void processPersons(\nList roster,\nPredicate tester,\nConsumer block) {\nfor (Person p : roster) {\nif (tester.test(p)) {\nblock.accept(p);\n}\n}\n}\n\nAs a result, the following method invocation is the same as when you invoked printPersons in Approach 3: Specify Search Criteria Code in a Local Class to obtain members who are eligible for Selective Service. The lambda expression used to print members is highlighted:\nprocessPersons(\nroster,\np -> p.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE\n&& p.getAge() >= 18\n&& p.getAge()  p.printPerson()\n);\n\nWhat if you want to do more with your members' profiles than printing them out. Suppose that you want to validate the members' profiles or retrieve their contact information? In this case, you need a functional interface that contains an abstract method that returns a value. The Function interface contains the method R apply(T t). The following method retrieves the data specified by the parameter mapper, and then performs an action on it specified by the parameter block:\npublic static void processPersonsWithFunction(\nList roster,\nPredicate tester,\nFunction mapper,\nConsumer block) {\nfor (Person p : roster) {\nif (tester.test(p)) {\nString data = mapper.apply(p);\nblock.accept(data);\n}\n}\n}\n\nThe following method retrieves the email address from each member contained in roster who is eligible for Selective Service and then prints it:\nprocessPersonsWithFunction(\nroster,\np -> p.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE\n&& p.getAge() >= 18\n&& p.getAge()  p.getEmailAddress(),\nemail -> System.out.println(email)\n);\n\n1.8 Approach 8: Use Generics More Extensively\nReconsider the method processPersonsWithFunction. The following is a generic version of it that accepts, as a parameter, a collection that contains elements of any data type:\npublic static  void processElements(\nIterable source,\nPredicate tester,\nFunction  mapper,\nConsumer block) {\nfor (X p : source) {\nif (tester.test(p)) {\nY data = mapper.apply(p);\nblock.accept(data);\n}\n}\n}\n\nTo print the e-mail address of members who are eligible for Selective Service, invoke the processElements method as follows:\nprocessElements(\nroster,\np -> p.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE\n&& p.getAge() >= 18\n&& p.getAge()  p.getEmailAddress(),\nemail -> System.out.println(email)\n);\n\nThis method invocation performs the following actions:\n\nObtains a source of objects from the collection source. In this example, it obtains a source of Person objects from the collection roster. Notice that the collection roster, which is a collection of type List, is also an object of type Iterable.\nFilters objects that match the Predicate object tester. In this example, the Predicate object is a lambda expression that specifies which members would be eligible for Selective Service.\nMaps each filtered object to a value as specified by the Function object mapper. In this example, the Function object is a lambda expression that returns the e-mail address of a member.\nPerforms an action on each mapped object as specified by the Consumer object block. In this example, the Consumer object is a lambda expression that prints a string, which is the e-mail address returned by the Function object.\n\nYou can replace each of these actions with an aggregate operation.\n1.9 Approach 9: Use Aggregate Operations That Accept Lambda Expressions as Parameters\nThe following example uses aggregate operations to print the e-mail addresses of those members contained in the collection roster who are eligible for Selective Service:\nroster\n.stream()\n.filter(\np -> p.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE\n&& p.getAge() >= 18\n&& p.getAge()  p.getEmailAddress())\n.forEach(email -> System.out.println(email));\n\nThe following table maps each of the operations the method processElements performs with the corresponding aggregate operation:\n\nThe operations filter, map, and forEach are aggregate operations. Aggregate operations process elements from a stream, not directly from a collection (which is the reason why the first method invoked in this example is stream). A stream is a sequence of elements. Unlike a collection, it is not a data structure that stores elements. Instead, a stream carries values from a source, such as collection, through a pipeline. A pipeline is a sequence of stream operations, which in this example is filter- map-forEach. In addition, aggregate operations typically accept lambda expressions as parameters, enabling you to customize how they behave.\nFor a more thorough discussion of aggregate operations, see the Aggregate Operations lesson.\n2. Lambda Expressions in GUI Applications\nTo process events in a graphical user interface (GUI) application, such as keyboard actions, mouse actions, and scroll actions, you typically create event handlers, which usually involves implementing a particular interface. Often, event handler interfaces are functional interfaces; they tend to have only one method.\nIn the JavaFX example HelloWorld.java (discussed in the previous section Anonymous Classes), you can replace the highlighted anonymous class with a lambda expression in this statement:\nbtn.setOnAction(new EventHandler() {\n@Override\npublic void handle(ActionEvent event) {\nSystem.out.println(\"Hello World!\");\n}\n});\n\nThe method invocation btn.setOnAction specifies what happens when you select the button represented by the btn object. This method requires an object of type EventHandler. The EventHandler interface contains only one method, void handle(T event). This interface is a functional interface, so you could use the following highlighted lambda expression to replace it:\nbtn.setOnAction(\nevent -> System.out.println(\"Hello World!\")\n);\n\n3. Syntax of Lambda Expressions\nA lambda expression consists of the following:\n\nA comma-separated list of formal parameters enclosed in parentheses. The CheckPerson.test method contains one parameter, p, which represents an instance of the Person class.\nNote: You can omit the data type of the parameters in a lambda expression. In addition, you can omit the parentheses if there is only one parameter. For example, the following lambda expression is also valid:p -> p.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE\n&& p.getAge() >= 18\n&& p.getAge() \n\nThe arrow token, ->\n\nA body, which consists of a single expression or a statement block. This example uses the following expression:\np.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE\n&& p.getAge() >= 18\n&& p.getAge() \nIf you specify a single expression, then the Java runtime evaluates the expression and then returns its value. Alternatively, you can use a return statement:\np -> {\nreturn p.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE\n&& p.getAge() >= 18\n&& p.getAge() \n\n\nA return statement is not an expression; in a lambda expression, you must enclose statements in braces ({}). However, you do not have to enclose a void method invocation in braces. For example, the following is a valid lambda expression:\nemail -> System.out.println(email)\n\nNote that a lambda expression looks a lot like a method declaration; you can consider lambda expressions as anonymous methods—methods without a name.\nThe following example, Calculator, is an example of lambda expressions that take more than one formal parameter:\npublic class Calculator {\ninterface IntegerMath {\nint operation(int a, int b);\n}\npublic int operateBinary(int a, int b, IntegerMath op) {\nreturn op.operation(a, b);\n}\npublic static void main(String... args) {\nCalculator myApp = new Calculator();\nIntegerMath addition = (a, b) -> a + b;\nIntegerMath subtraction = (a, b) -> a - b;\nSystem.out.println(\"40 + 2 = \" +\nmyApp.operateBinary(40, 2, addition));\nSystem.out.println(\"20 - 10 = \" +\nmyApp.operateBinary(20, 10, subtraction));\n}\n}\n\nThe method operateBinary performs a mathematical operation on two integer operands. The operation itself is specified by an instance of IntegerMath. The example defines two operations with lambda expressions, addition and subtraction. The example prints the following:\n40 + 2 = 42\n20 - 10 = 10\n\n4. Target Typing\nHow do you determine the type of a lambda expression? Recall the lambda expression that selected members who are male and between the ages 18 and 25 years:\np -> p.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE\n&& p.getAge() >= 18\n&& p.getAge() \nThis lambda expression was used in the following two methods:\n\npublic static void printPersons(List roster, CheckPerson tester) in Approach 3: Specify Search Criteria Code in a Local Class\n\npublic void printPersonsWithPredicate(List roster, Predicate tester) in Approach 6: Use Standard Functional Interfaces with Lambda Expressions\n\n\nWhen the Java runtime invokes the method printPersons, it's expecting a data type of CheckPerson, so the lambda expression is of this type. However, when the Java runtime invokes the method printPersonsWithPredicate, it's expecting a data type of Predicate, so the lambda expression is of this type. The data type that these methods expect is called the target type. To determine the type of a lambda expression, the Java compiler uses the target type of the context or situation in which the lambda expression was found. It follows that you can only use lambda expressions in situations in which the Java compiler can determine a target type:\nVariable declarations\n\nAssignments\nReturn statements\nArray initializers\nMethod or constructor arguments\nLambda expression bodies\nConditional expressions, ?:\nCast expressions\n\nTarget Types and Method Arguments\nFor method arguments, the Java compiler determines the target type with two other language features: overload resolution and type argument inference.\nConsider the following two functional interfaces ( java.lang.Runnable and java.util.concurrent.Callable):\npublic interface Runnable {\nvoid run();\n}\n\npublic interface Callable {\nV call();\n}\n\nThe method Runnable.run does not return a value, whereas Callable.call does.\nSuppose that you have overloaded the method invoke as follows (see Defining Methods for more information about overloading methods):\nvoid invoke(Runnable r) {\nr.run();\n}\n\n T invoke(Callable c) {\nreturn c.call();\n}\n\nWhich method will be invoked in the following statement?\nString s = invoke(() -> \"done\");\n\nThe method invoke(Callable) will be invoked because that method returns a value; the method invoke(Runnable) does not. In this case, the type of the lambda expression () -> \"done\" is Callable.\nSerialization\nYou can serialize a lambda expression if its target type and its captured arguments are serializable. However, like inner classes, the serialization of lambda expressions is strongly discouraged.\n"},"java-quick-review/chapter11_aggregate-operations.html":{"url":"java-quick-review/chapter11_aggregate-operations.html","title":"Aggregate Operation","keywords":"","body":"#\nAggregate Operations\nNote: To better understand the concepts in this section, review the sections Lambda Expressions and Method References.\nFor what do you use collections? You don't simply store objects in a collection and leave them there. In most cases, you use collections to retrieve items stored in them.\nConsider again the scenario described in the section Lambda Expressions. Suppose that you are creating a social networking application. You want to create a feature that enables an administrator to perform any kind of action, such as sending a message, on members of the social networking application that satisfy certain criteria.\npublic class Person {\npublic enum Sex {\nMALE, FEMALE\n}\nString name;\nLocalDate birthday;\nSex gender;\nString emailAddress;\n// ...\npublic int getAge() {\n// ...\n}\npublic String getName() {\n// ...\n}\n}\n\nThe following example prints the name of all members contained in the collection roster with a for-each loop:\nfor (Person p : roster) {\nSystem.out.println(p.getName());\n}\n\nThe following example prints all members contained in the collection roster but with the aggregate operation forEach:\nroster\n.stream()\n.forEach(e -> System.out.println(e.getName());\n\nAlthough, in this example, the version that uses aggregate operations is longer than the one that uses a for-each loop, you will see that versions that use bulk-data operations will be more concise for more complex tasks.\nThe following topics are covered:\n\nPipelines and Streams\nDifferences Between Aggregate Operations and Iterators\n\n1.1 Pipelines and Streams\nA pipeline is a sequence of aggregate operations. The following example prints the male members contained in the collection roster with a pipeline that consists of the aggregate operations filter and forEach:\nroster\n.stream()\n.filter(e -> e.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE)\n.forEach(e -> System.out.println(e.getName()));\n\nCompare this example to the following that prints the male members contained in the collection roster with a for-each loop:\nfor (Person p : roster) {\nif (p.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE) {\nSystem.out.println(p.getName());\n}\n}\n\nA pipeline contains the following components:\n\nA source: This could be a collection, an array, a generator function, or an I/O channel. In this example, the source is the collection roster.\nZero or more intermediate operations. An intermediate operation, such as filter, produces a new stream.\nA stream is a sequence of elements. Unlike a collection, it is not a data structure that stores elements. Instead, a stream carries values from a source through a pipeline. This example creates a stream from the collection roster by invoking the method stream.\nThe filter operation returns a new stream that contains elements that match its predicate (this operation's parameter). In this example, the predicate is the lambda expression e -> e.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE. It returns the boolean value true if the gender field of object e has the value Person.Sex.MALE. Consequently, the filter operation in this example returns a stream that contains all male members in the collection roster.\n\nA terminal operation. A terminal operation, such as forEach, produces a non-stream result, such as a primitive value (like a double value), a collection, or in the case of forEach, no value at all. In this example, the parameter of the forEach operation is the lambda expression e -> System.out.println(e.getName()), which invokes the method getName on the object e. (The Java runtime and compiler infer that the type of the object e is Person.)\n\n\nThe following example calculates the average age of all male members contained in the collection roster with a pipeline that consists of the aggregate operations filter, mapToInt, and average:\ndouble average = roster\n.stream()\n.filter(p -> p.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE)\n.mapToInt(Person::getAge)\n.average()\n.getAsDouble();\n\nThe mapToInt operation returns a new stream of type IntStream (which is a stream that contains only integer values). The operation applies the function specified in its parameter to each element in a particular stream. In this example, the function is Person::getAge, which is a method reference that returns the age of the member. (Alternatively, you could use the lambda expression e -> e.getAge().) Consequently, the mapToInt operation in this example returns a stream that contains the ages of all male members in the collection roster.\nThe average operation calculates the average value of the elements contained in a stream of type IntStream. It returns an object of type OptionalDouble. If the stream contains no elements, then the average operation returns an empty instance of OptionalDouble, and invoking the method getAsDouble throws a NoSuchElementException. The JDK contains many terminal operations such as average that return one value by combining the contents of a stream. These operations are called reduction operations; see the section Reduction for more information.\n1.2 Differences Between Aggregate Operations and Iterators\nAggregate operations, like forEach, appear to be like iterators. However, they have several fundamental differences:\n\nThey use internal iteration: Aggregate operations do not contain a method like next to instruct them to process the next element of the collection. With internal delegation, your application determines what collection it iterates, but the JDK determines how to iterate the collection. With external iteration, your application determines both what collection it iterates and how it iterates it. However, external iteration can only iterate over the elements of a collection sequentially. Internal iteration does not have this limitation. It can more easily take advantage of parallel computing, which involves dividing a problem into subproblems, solving those problems simultaneously, and then combining the results of the solutions to the subproblems. See the section Parallelism for more information.\n\nThey process elements from a stream: Aggregate operations process elements from a stream, not directly from a collection. Consequently, they are also called stream operations.\n\nThey support behavior as parameters: You can specify lambda expressions as parameters for most aggregate operations. This enables you to customize the behavior of a particular aggregate operation.\n\n\n2. Reduction (one of the terminal operations)\nTerminal operations:\n\nThe section Aggregate Operations describes the following pipeline of operations, which calculates the average age of all male members in the collection roster:\ndouble average = roster\n.stream()\n.filter(p -> p.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE)\n.mapToInt(Person::getAge)\n.average()\n.getAsDouble();\n\nThe JDK contains many terminal operations (such as average, sum, min, max, and count) that return one value by combining the contents of a stream. These operations are called reduction operations. The JDK also contains reduction operations that return a collection instead of a single value. Many reduction operations perform a specific task, such as finding the average of values or grouping elements into categories. However, the JDK provides you with the general-purpose reduction operations reduce and collect, which this section describes in detail.\nThis section covers the following topics:\n\nThe Stream.reduce Method\nThe Stream.collect Method\n\n2.1 The Stream.reduce Method\nThe Stream.reduce method is a general-purpose reduction operation. Consider the following pipeline, which calculates the sum of the male members' ages in the collection roster. It uses the Stream.sum reduction operation:\nInteger totalAge = roster\n.stream()\n.mapToInt(Person::getAge)\n.sum();\n\nCompare this with the following pipeline, which uses the Stream.reduce operation to calculate the same value:\nInteger totalAgeReduce = roster\n.stream()\n.map(Person::getAge)\n.reduce(0,(a, b) -> a + b);\n\nThe reduce operation in this example takes two arguments:\n\nidentity: The identity element is both the initial value of the reduction and the default result if there are no elements in the stream. In this example, the identity element is 0; this is the initial value of the sum of ages and the default value if no members exist in the collection roster.\n\naccumulator: The accumulator function takes two parameters: a partial result of the reduction (in this example, the sum of all processed integers so far) and the next element of the stream (in this example, an integer). It returns a new partial result. In this example, the accumulator function is a lambda expression that adds two Integer values and returns an Integer value:\n(a, b) -> a + b\n\n\n\nThe reduce operation always returns a new value. However, the accumulator function also returns a new value every time it processes an element of a stream. Suppose that you want to reduce the elements of a stream to a more complex object, such as a collection. This might hinder the performance of your application. If your reduce operation involves adding elements to a collection, then every time your accumulator function processes an element, it creates a new collection that includes the element, which is inefficient. It would be more efficient for you to update an existing collection instead. You can do this with the Stream.collect method, which the next section describes.\n2.2 The Stream.collect Method\nUnlike the reduce method, which always creates a new value when it processes an element, the collect method modifies, or mutates, an existing value.\nConsider how to find the average of values in a stream. You require two pieces of data: the total number of values and the sum of those values. However, like the reduce method and all other reduction methods, the collect method returns only one value. You can create a new data type that contains member variables that keep track of the total number of values and the sum of those values, such as the following class, Averager:\nclass Averager implements IntConsumer{\nprivate int total = 0;\nprivate int count = 0;\npublic double average() {\nreturn count > 0 ? ((double) total)/count : 0;\n}\npublic void accept(int i) { total += i; count++; }\npublic void combine(Averager other) {\ntotal += other.total;\ncount += other.count;\n}\n}\n\nThe following pipeline uses the Averager class and the collect method to calculate the average age of all male members:\nAverager averageCollect = roster.stream()\n.filter(p -> p.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE)\n.map(Person::getAge)\n.collect(Averager::new, Averager::accept, Averager::combine);\nSystem.out.println(\"Average age of male members: \" +\naverageCollect.average());\nThe collect operation in this example takes three arguments:\n\nsupplier: The supplier is a factory function; it constructs new instances. For the collect operation, it creates instances of the result container. In this example, it is a new instance of the Averager class.\naccumulator: The accumulator function incorporates a stream element into a result container. In this example, it modifies the Averager result container by incrementing the count variable by one and adding to the total member variable the value of the stream element, which is an integer representing the age of a male member.\ncombiner: The combiner function takes two result containers and merges their contents. In this example, it modifies an Averager result container by incrementing the count variable by the count member variable of the other Averager instance and adding to the total member variable the value of the other Averager instance's total member variable.\n\nNote the following:\n\nThe supplier is a lambda expression (or a method reference) as opposed to a value like the identity element in the reduce operation.\nThe accumulator and combiner functions do not return a value.\nYou can use the collect operations with parallel streams; see the section Parallelism for more information. (If you run the collect method with a parallel stream, then the JDK creates a new thread whenever the combiner function creates a new object, such as an Averager object in this example. Consequently, you do not have to worry about synchronization.)\n\nAlthough the JDK provides you with the average operation to calculate the average value of elements in a stream, you can use the collect operation and a custom class if you need to calculate several values from the elements of a stream.\nThe collect operation is best suited for collections. The following example puts the names of the male members in a collection with the collect operation:\nList namesOfMaleMembersCollect = roster\n.stream()\n.filter(p -> p.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE)\n.map(p -> p.getName())\n.collect(Collectors.toList());\n\nThis version of the collect operation takes one parameter of type Collector. This class encapsulates the functions used as arguments in the collect operation that requires three arguments (supplier, accumulator, and combiner functions).\nThe Collectors class contains many useful reduction operations, such as accumulating elements into collections and summarizing elements according to various criteria. These reduction operations return instances of the class Collector, so you can use them as a parameter for the collect operation.\nThis example uses the Collectors.toList operation, which accumulates the stream elements into a new instance of List. As with most operations in the Collectors class, the toList operator returns an instance of Collector, not a collection.\nThe following example groups members of the collection roster by gender:\nMap> byGender =\nroster\n.stream()\n.collect(\nCollectors.groupingBy(Person::getGender));\n\nThe groupingBy operation returns a map whose keys are the values that result from applying the lambda expression specified as its parameter (which is called a classification function). In this example, the returned map contains two keys, Person.Sex.MALE and Person.Sex.FEMALE. The keys' corresponding values are instances of List that contain the stream elements that, when processed by the classification function, correspond to the key value. For example, the value that corresponds to key Person.Sex.MALE is an instance of List that contains all male members.\nThe following example retrieves the names of each member in the collection roster and groups them by gender:\nMap> namesByGender =\nroster\n.stream()\n.collect(\nCollectors.groupingBy(\nPerson::getGender,\nCollectors.mapping(\nPerson::getName,\nCollectors.toList())));\n\nThe groupingBy operation in this example takes two parameters, a classification function and an instance of Collector. The Collector parameter is called a downstream collector. This is a collector that the Java runtime applies to the results of another collector. Consequently, this groupingBy operation enables you to apply a collect method to the List values created by the groupingBy operator. This example applies the collector mapping, which applies the mapping function Person::getName to each element of the stream. Consequently, the resulting stream consists of only the names of members. A pipeline that contains one or more downstream collectors, like this example, is called a multilevel reduction.\nThe following example retrieves the total age of members of each gender:\nMap totalAgeByGender =\nroster\n.stream()\n.collect(\nCollectors.groupingBy(\nPerson::getGender,\nCollectors.reducing(0,\nPerson::getAge,\nInteger::sum)));\n\nThe reducing operation takes three parameters:\nidentity: Like the Stream.reduce operation, the identity element is both the initial value of the reduction and the default result if there are no elements in the stream. In this example, the identity element is 0; this is the initial value of the sum of ages and the default value if no members exist.\nmapper: The reducing operation applies this mapper function to all stream elements. In this example, the mapper retrieves the age of each member.\noperation: The operation function is used to reduce the mapped values. In this example, the operation function adds Integer values.\nThe following example retrieves the average age of members of each gender:\nMap averageAgeByGender = roster\n.stream()\n.collect(\nCollectors.groupingBy(\nPerson::getGender,\nCollectors.averagingInt(Person::getAge)));\n\n3. Parallelism\nParallel computing involves dividing a problem into subproblems, solving those problems simultaneously (in parallel, with each subproblem running in a separate thread), and then combining the results of the solutions to the subproblems. Java SE provides the fork/join framework, which enables you to more easily implement parallel computing in your applications. However, with this framework, you must specify how the problems are subdivided (partitioned). With aggregate operations, the Java runtime performs this partitioning and combining of solutions for you.\nOne difficulty in implementing parallelism in applications that use collections is that collections are not thread-safe, which means that multiple threads cannot manipulate a collection without introducing thread interference or memory consistency errors. The Collections Framework provides synchronization wrappers, which add automatic synchronization to an arbitrary collection, making it thread-safe. However, synchronization introduces thread contention. You want to avoid thread contention because it prevents threads from running in parallel. Aggregate operations and parallel streams enable you to implement parallelism with non-thread-safe collections provided that you do not modify the collection while you are operating on it.\nNote that parallelism is not automatically faster than performing operations serially, although it can be if you have enough data and processor cores. While aggregate operations enable you to more easily implement parallelism, it is still your responsibility to determine if your application is suitable for parallelism.\nThis section covers the following topics:\n\nExecuting Streams in Parallel\nConcurrent Reduction\nOrdering\nSide Effects\nLaziness\nInterference\nStateful Lambda Expressions\n\n3.1 Executing Streams in Parallel\nYou can execute streams in serial or in parallel. When a stream executes in parallel, the Java runtime partitions the stream into multiple substreams. Aggregate operations iterate over and process these substreams in parallel and then combine the results.\nWhen you create a stream, it is always a serial stream unless otherwise specified. To create a parallel stream, invoke the operation Collection.parallelStream. Alternatively, invoke the operation BaseStream.parallel. For example, the following statement calculates the average age of all male members in parallel:\ndouble average = roster\n.parallelStream()\n.filter(p -> p.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE)\n.mapToInt(Person::getAge)\n.average()\n.getAsDouble();\n\n3.2 Concurrent Reduction\nConsider again the following example (which is described in the section Reduction) that groups members by gender. This example invokes the collect operation, which reduces the collection roster into a Map:\nMap> byGender =\nroster\n.stream()\n.collect(\nCollectors.groupingBy(Person::getGender));\nThe following is the parallel equivalent:\n\nConcurrentMap> byGender =\nroster\n.parallelStream()\n.collect(\nCollectors.groupingByConcurrent(Person::getGender));\n\nThis is called a concurrent reduction. The Java runtime performs a concurrent reduction if all of the the following are true for a particular pipeline that contains the collect operation:\n\nThe stream is parallel.\nThe parameter of the collect operation, the collector, has the characteristic Collector.Characteristics.CONCURRENT. To determine the characteristics of a collector, invoke the Collector.characteristics method.\nEither the stream is unordered, or the collector has the characteristic Collector.Characteristics.UNORDERED. To ensure that the stream is unordered, invoke the BaseStream.unordered operation.\n\nNote: This example returns an instance of ConcurrentMap instead of Map and invokes the groupingByConcurrent operation instead of groupingBy. (See the section Concurrent Collections for more information about ConcurrentMap.) Unlike the operation groupingByConcurrent, the operation groupingBy performs poorly with parallel streams. (This is because it operates by merging two maps by key, which is computationally expensive.) Similarly, the operation Collectors.toConcurrentMap performs better with parallel streams than the operation Collectors.toMap.\n3.3 Ordering\nThe order in which a pipeline processes the elements of a stream depends on whether the stream is executed in serial or in parallel, the source of the stream, and intermediate operations. For example, consider the following example that prints the elements of an instance of ArrayList with the forEach operation several times:\nInteger[] intArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 };\nList listOfIntegers =\nnew ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(intArray));\n\nSystem.out.println(\"listOfIntegers:\");\nlistOfIntegers\n.stream()\n.forEach(e -> System.out.print(e + \" \"));\nSystem.out.println(\"\");\n\nSystem.out.println(\"listOfIntegers sorted in reverse order:\");\nComparator normal = Integer::compare;\nComparator reversed = normal.reversed();\nCollections.sort(listOfIntegers, reversed);\nlistOfIntegers\n.stream()\n.forEach(e -> System.out.print(e + \" \"));\nSystem.out.println(\"\");\nSystem.out.println(\"Parallel stream\");\nlistOfIntegers\n.parallelStream()\n.forEach(e -> System.out.print(e + \" \"));\nSystem.out.println(\"\");\nSystem.out.println(\"Another parallel stream:\");\nlistOfIntegers\n.parallelStream()\n.forEach(e -> System.out.print(e + \" \"));\nSystem.out.println(\"\");\nSystem.out.println(\"With forEachOrdered:\");\nlistOfIntegers\n.parallelStream()\n.forEachOrdered(e -> System.out.print(e + \" \"));\nSystem.out.println(\"\");\n\nThis example consists of five pipelines. It prints output similar to the following:\nlistOfIntegers:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\nlistOfIntegers sorted in reverse order:\n8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1\nParallel stream:\n3 4 1 6 2 5 7 8\nAnother parallel stream:\n6 3 1 5 7 8 4 2\nWith forEachOrdered:\n8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1\n\nThis example does the following:\n\nThe first pipeline prints the elements of the list listOfIntegers in the order that they were added to the list.\nThe second pipeline prints the elements of listOfIntegers after it was sorted by the method Collections.sort.\nThe third and fourth pipelines print the elements of the list in an apparently random order. Remember that stream operations use internal iteration when processing elements of a stream. Consequently, when you execute a stream in parallel, the Java compiler and runtime determine the order in which to process the stream's elements to maximize the benefits of parallel computing unless otherwise specified by the stream operation.\nThe fifth pipeline uses the method forEachOrdered, which processes the elements of the stream in the order specified by its source, regardless of whether you executed the stream in serial or parallel. Note that you may lose the benefits of parallelism if you use operations like forEachOrdered with parallel streams.\n\n3.4 Side Effects\nA method or an expression has a side effect if, in addition to returning or producing a value, it also modifies the state of the computer. Examples include mutable reductions (operations that use the collect operation; see the section Reduction for more information) as well as invoking the System.out.println method for debugging. The JDK handles certain side effects in pipelines well. In particular, the collect method is designed to perform the most common stream operations that have side effects in a parallel-safe manner. Operations like forEach and peek are designed for side effects; a lambda expression that returns void, such as one that invokes System.out.println, can do nothing but have side effects. Even so, you should use the forEach and peek operations with care; if you use one of these operations with a parallel stream, then the Java runtime may invoke the lambda expression that you specified as its parameter concurrently from multiple threads. In addition, never pass as parameters lambda expressions that have side effects in operations such as filter and map. The following sections discuss interference and stateful lambda expressions, both of which can be sources of side effects and can return inconsistent or unpredictable results, especially in parallel streams. However, the concept of laziness is discussed first, because it has a direct effect on interference.\n3.5 Laziness\nAll intermediate operations are lazy. An expression, method, or algorithm is lazy if its value is evaluated only when it is required. (An algorithm is eager if it is evaluated or processed immediately.) Intermediate operations are lazy because they do not start processing the contents of the stream until the terminal operation commences. Processing streams lazily enables the Java compiler and runtime to optimize how they process streams. For example, in a pipeline such as the filter-mapToInt-average example described in the section Aggregate Operations, the average operation could obtain the first several integers from the stream created by the mapToInt operation, which obtains elements from the filter operation. The average operation would repeat this process until it had obtained all required elements from the stream, and then it would calculate the average.\n3.6 Interference\nLambda expressions in stream operations should not interfere. Interference occurs when the source of a stream is modified while a pipeline processes the stream. For example, the following code attempts to concatenate the strings contained in the List listOfStrings. However, it throws a ConcurrentModificationException:\ntry {\nList listOfStrings =\nnew ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(\"one\", \"two\"));\n// This will fail as the peek operation will attempt to add the\n// string \"three\" to the source after the terminal operation has\n// commenced.\nString concatenatedString = listOfStrings\n.stream()\n// Don't do this! Interference occurs here.\n.peek(s -> listOfStrings.add(\"three\"))\n.reduce((a, b) -> a + \" \" + b)\n.get();\nSystem.out.println(\"Concatenated string: \" + concatenatedString);\n} catch (Exception e) {\nSystem.out.println(\"Exception caught: \" + e.toString());\n}\n\nThis example concatenates the strings contained in listOfStrings into an Optional value with the reduce operation, which is a terminal operation. However, the pipeline here invokes the intermediate operation peek, which attempts to add a new element to listOfStrings. Remember, all intermediate operations are lazy. This means that the pipeline in this example begins execution when the operation get is invoked, and ends execution when the get operation completes. The argument of the peek operation attempts to modify the stream source during the execution of the pipeline, which causes the Java runtime to throw a ConcurrentModificationException.\n3.7 Stateful Lambda Expressions\nAvoid using stateful lambda expressions as parameters in stream operations. A stateful lambda expression is one whose result depends on any state that might change during the execution of a pipeline. The following example adds elements from the List listOfIntegers to a new List instance with the map intermediate operation. It does this twice, first with a serial stream and then with a parallel stream:\nList serialStorage = new ArrayList<>();\nSystem.out.println(\"Serial stream:\");\nlistOfIntegers\n.stream()\n// Don't do this! It uses a stateful lambda expression.\n.map(e -> { serialStorage.add(e); return e; })\n.forEachOrdered(e -> System.out.print(e + \" \"));\nSystem.out.println(\"\");\nserialStorage\n.stream()\n.forEachOrdered(e -> System.out.print(e + \" \"));\nSystem.out.println(\"\");\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Parallel stream:\");\nList parallelStorage = Collections.synchronizedList(\nnew ArrayList<>());\nlistOfIntegers\n.parallelStream()\n// Don't do this! It uses a stateful lambda expression.\n.map(e -> { parallelStorage.add(e); return e; })\n.forEachOrdered(e -> System.out.print(e + \" \"));\nSystem.out.println(\"\");\nparallelStorage\n.stream()\n.forEachOrdered(e -> System.out.print(e + \" \"));\nSystem.out.println(\"\");\n\nThe lambda expression e -> { parallelStorage.add(e); return e; } is a stateful lambda expression. Its result can vary every time the code is run. This example prints the following:\nSerial stream:\n8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1\n8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1\nParallel stream:\n8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1\n1 3 6 2 4 5 8 7\n\nThe operation forEachOrdered processes elements in the order specified by the stream, regardless of whether the stream is executed in serial or parallel. However, when a stream is executed in parallel, the map operation processes elements of the stream specified by the Java runtime and compiler. Consequently, the order in which the lambda expression e -> { parallelStorage.add(e); return e; } adds elements to the List parallelStorage can vary every time the code is run. For deterministic and predictable results, ensure that lambda expression parameters in stream operations are not stateful.\nNote: This example invokes the method synchronizedList so that the List parallelStorage is thread-safe. Remember that collections are not thread-safe. This means that multiple threads should not access a particular collection at the same time. Suppose that you do not invoke the method synchronizedList when creating parallelStorage:\nList parallelStorage = new ArrayList<>();\n\nThe example behaves erratically because multiple threads access and modify parallelStorage without a mechanism like synchronization to schedule when a particular thread may access the List instance. Consequently, the example could print output similar to the following:\nParallel stream:\n8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1\nnull 3 5 4 7 8 1 2\n\n"},"java-quick-review/appendix-i_HashMap.html":{"url":"java-quick-review/appendix-i_HashMap.html","title":"Appendix-HashMap","keywords":"","body":"How does HashMap work in Java\n  1 Internal storage\n  2 Auto resizing\n  3 Thread Safety\n  4 Key immutability\n  5 JAVA 8 improvements\n  6 Memory overhead\n  6.1 JAVA 7\n  6.2 JAVA 8\n  7 Performance issues\n  7.1 Skewed HashMap vs well balanced HashMap\n  7.2 Resizing overhead\n1. Internal Storage\n1.1 Internal Structure\nThe JAVA HashMap class implements the interface Map. The main methods of this interface are:\n\nV put(K key, V value)\nV get(Object key)\nV remove(Object key)\nBoolean containsKey(Object key)\n\nHashMaps use an inner class to store data: the Entry. This entry is a simple key-value pair with two extra data:\n\nA reference to another Entry so that a HashMap can store entries like singly linked lists\nA hash value that represents the hash value of the key. This hash value is stored to avoid the computation of the hash every time the HashMap needs it.\n\nHere is a part of the Entry implementation in JAVA 7:\nstatic class Entry implements Map.Entry {\nfinal K key;\nV value;\nEntry next;\nint hash;\n…\n}\n\n1.2 How to CRUD data\nA HashMap stores data into multiple singly linked lists of entries. All the lists are registered in an array of Entry (Entry[] array) and the default capacity of this inner array is 16.\n\nAll the keys with the same hash value are put in the same linked list (bucket). Keys with different hash values can end-up in the same bucket.\nWhen a user calls put(K key, V value) or get(Object key), the function computes the index of the bucket in which the Entry should be. Then, the function iterates through the list to look for the Entry that has the same key (using the equals() function of the key).\nIn the case of the get(), the function returns the value associated with the entry (if the entry exists).\nIn the case of the put(K key, V value), if the entry exists the function replaces it with the new value otherwise it creates a new entry (from the key and value in arguments) at the head of the singly linked list.\n1.3 How to calculate hashCode\nThis index of the bucket (linked list) is generated in 3 steps by the map:\n\nIt first gets the hashcode of the key.\nIt rehashes the hashcode to prevent against a bad hashing function from the key that would put all data in the same index (bucket) of the inner array\nIt takes the rehashed hash hashcode and bit-masks it with the length (minus 1) of the array. This operation assures that the index can’t be greater than the size of the array. You can see it as a very computationally optimized modulo function.\n\nHere is the JAVA 7 and 8 source code that deals with the index:\n// JAVA 7: the \"rehash\" function\nstatic int hash(int h) {\nh ^= (h >>> 20) ^ (h >>> 12);\nreturn h ^ (h >>> 7) ^ (h >>> 4);\n}\n\n// JAVA 8: the \"rehash\" function\nstatic final int hash(Object key) {\nint h;\nreturn (key == null) ? 0 : (h = key.hashCode()) ^ (h >>> 16);\n}\n// the function that returns the index from the rehashed hash\nstatic int indexFor(int h, int length) {\nreturn h & (length-1);\n}\n\nIn order to work efficiently, the size of the inner array needs to be a power of 2, let’s see why.\nImagine the array size is 17, the mask value is going to be 16 (size -1). The binary representation of 16 is 0…010000, so for any hash value H the index generated with the bitwise formula “H AND 16” is going to be either 16 or 0. This means that the array of size 17 will only be used for 2 buckets: the one at index 0 and the one at index 16, not very efficient…\nBut, if you now take a size that is a power of 2 like 16, the bitwise index formula is “H AND 15”. The binary representation of 15 is 0…001111 so the index formula can output values from 0 to 15 and the array of size 16 is fully used. For example:\n\nif H = 952 , its binary representation is 0..01110111000, the associated index is 0…01000 = 8\nif H = 1576 its binary representation is 0..011000101000, the associated index is 0…01000 = 8\nif H = 12356146, its binary representation is 0..0101111001000101000110010, the associated index is 0…00010 = 2\nif H = 59843, its binary representation is 0..01110100111000011, the associated index is 0…00011 = 3\nThis is why the array size is a power of two. This mechanism is transparent for the developer: if he chooses a HashMap with a size of 37, the Map will automatically choose the next power of 2 after 37 (64) for the size of its inner array.\n\n2. Auto resizing\nAfter getting the index, the function (get, put or remove) visits/iterates the associated linked list to see if there is an existing Entry for the given key. Without modification, this mechanism could lead to performance issues because the function needs to iterate through the entire list to see if the entry exists. Imagine that the size of the inner array is the default value (16) and you need to store 2 millions values. In the best case scenario, each linked list will have a size of 125 000 entries (2/16 millions). So, each get(), remove() and put() will lead to 125 000 iterations/operations. To avoid this case, the HashMap has the ability to increase its inner array in order to keep very short linked lists.\nWhen you create a HashMap, you can specify an initial size and a loadFactor with the following constructor:\npublic HashMap(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor)\n\nIf you don’t specify arguments, the default initialCapacity is 16 and the default loadFactor is 0.75. The initialCapacity represents to the size of the inner array of linked lists.\nEach time you add a new key/value in your Map with put(…), the function checks if it needs to increase the capacity of the inner array. In order to do that, the map stores 2 data:\n\nThe size of the map: it represents the number of entries in the HashMap. This value is updated each time an Entry is added or removed.\nA threshold: it’s equal to (capacity of the inner array) * loadFactor and it is refreshed after each resize of the inner array\n\nBefore adding the new Entry, put(…) checks if size > threshold and if it the case it recreates a new array with a doubled size. Since the size of the new array has changed, the indexing function (which returns the bitwise operation “hash(key) AND (sizeOfArray-1)”) changes. So, the resizing of the array creates twice more buckets (i.e. linked lists) and redistributes all the existing entries into the buckets (the old ones and the newly created).\nThis aim of this resize operation is to decrease the size of the linked lists so that the time cost of put(), remove() and get() methods stays low. All entries whose keys have the same hash will stay in the same bucket after the resizing. But, 2 entries with different hash keys that were in the same bucket before might not be in the same bucket after the transformation.\nNote: the HashMap only increases the size of the inner array, it doesn’t provide a way to decrease it.\n3. Thread Safety\nIf you already know HashMaps, you know that is not threads safe, but why? For example imagine that you have a Writer thread that puts only new data into the Map and a Reader thread that reads data from the Map, why shouldn’t it work?\nBecause during the auto-resizing mechanism, if a thread tries to put or get an object, the map might use the old index value and won’t find the new bucket in which the entry is.\nThe worst case scenario is when 2 threads put a data at the same time and the 2 put() calls resize the Map at the same time. Since both threads modify the linked lists at the same time, the Map might end up with an inner-loop in one of its linked lists. If you tries to get a data in the list with an inner loop, the get() will never end.\nThe HashTable implementation is a thread safe implementation that prevents from this situation. But, since all the CRUD methods are synchronized this implementation is very slow. For example, if thread 1 calls get(key1), thread 2 calls get(key2) and thread 3 calls get(key3), only one thread at a time will be able to get its value whereas the 3 of them could access the data at the same time.\nA smarter implementation of a thread safe HashMap exists since JAVA 5: the ConcurrentHashMap. Only the buckets are synchronized so multiples threads can get(), remove() or put() data at the same time if it doesn’t imply accessing the same bucket or resizing the inner array. It’s better to use this implementation in a multithreaded application.\n4. Key immutability\nWhy String and Integer are a good implementation of keys for HashMap? Mostly because they are immutable! If you choose to create your own Key class and don’t make it immutable, you might lose data inside the HashMap.\nLook at the following use case:\n\nYou have a key that has an inner value “1”\nYou put an object in the HashMap with this key\nThe HashMap generates a hash from the hashcode of the Key (so from “1”)\nThe Map stores this hash in the newly created Entry\nYou modify the inner value of the key to “2”\nThe hash value of the key is modified but the HashMap doesn’t know it (because the old hash value is stored)\nYou try to get your object with your modified key\nThe map computes the new hash of your key (so from “2”) to find in which linked list (bucket) the entry is\nCase 1: Since you modified your key, the map tries to find the entry in the wrong bucket and doesn’t find it\ncase 2: Luckily, the modified key generates the same bucket as the old key. The map then iterates through the linked list to find the entry with the same key. But to find the key, the map first compares the hash values and then calls the equals() comparison. Since your modified key doesn’t have the same hash as the old hash value (stored in the entry), the map won’t find the entry in the linked-list.\nHere is a concrete example in Java. I put 2 key-value pairs in my Map, I modify the first key and then try to get the 2 values. Only the second value is returned from the map, the first value is “lost” in the HashMap:\n\npublic class MutableKeyTest {\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\nclass MyKey {\nInteger i;\npublic void setI(Integer i) { this.i = i; }\npublic MyKey(Integer i) { this.i = i;}\n\n@Override\npublic int hashCode() {return i;}\n@Override\npublic boolean equals(Object obj) {\nif (obj instanceof MyKey) {\nreturn i.equals(((MyKey) obj).i);\n} else\nreturn false;\n}\n}\n\nMap myMap = new HashMap<>();\nMyKey key1 = new MyKey(1);\nMyKey key2 = new MyKey(2);\nmyMap.put(key1, \"test \" + 1);\nmyMap.put(key2, \"test \" + 2);\n\n// modifying key1\nkey1.setI(3);\n\nString test1 = myMap.get(key1);\nString test2 = myMap.get(key2);\n\nSystem.out.println(\"test1= \" + test1 + \" test2=\" + test2);\n}\n}\n\nThe output is: “test1= null test2=test 2”. As expected, the Map wasn’t able to retrieve the string 1 with the modified key 1.\n5. JAVA 8 improvements\nThe inner representation of the HashMap has changed a lot in JAVA 8. Indeed, the implementation in JAVA 7 takes 1k lines of code whereas the implementation in JAVA 8 takes 2k lines. Most of what I’ve said previously is true except the linked lists of entries. In JAVA8, you still have an array but it now stores Nodes that contains the exact same information as Entries and therefore are also linked lists:\nHere is a part of the Node implementation in JAVA 8:\nstatic class Node implements Map.Entry {\nfinal int hash;\nfinal K key;\nV value;\nNode next;\n...\n}\n\nSo what’s the big difference with JAVA 7? Well, Nodes can be extended to TreeNodes. A TreeNode is a red-black tree structure that stores really more information so that it can add, delete or get an element in O(log(n)).\nFYI, here is the exhaustive list of the data stored inside a TreeNode\nstatic final class TreeNode extends LinkedHashMap.Entry {\nfinal int hash; // inherited from Node\nfinal K key; // inherited from Node\nV value; // inherited from Node\nNode next; // inherited from Node\nEntry before, after;// inherited from LinkedHashMap.Entry\nTreeNode parent;\nTreeNode left;\nTreeNode right;\nTreeNode prev;\nboolean red;\n}\n\nRed black trees are self-balancing binary search trees. Their inner mechanisms ensure that their length is always in log(n) despite new adds or removes of nodes. The main advantage to use those trees is in a case where many data are in the same index (bucket) of the inner table, the search in a tree will cost O(log(n)) whereas it would have cost O(n) with a linked list.\nAs you see, the tree takes really more space than the linked list (we’ll speak about it in the next part).\nBy inheritance, the inner table can contain both Node (linked list ) and TreeNode (red-black tree). Oracle decided to use both data structures with the following rules:\n\nIf for a given index (bucket) in the inner table there are more than 8 nodes, the linked list is transformed into a red black tree\nIf for a given index (bucket) in the inner table there are less than 6 nodes, the tree is transformed into a linked list\n\nThis picture shows an inner array of a JAVA 8 HashMap with both trees (at bucket 0) and linked lists (at bucket 1,2 and 3). Bucket 0 is a Tree because it has more than 8 nodes.\n\n6. Memory overhead\n6.1 JAVA 7\nThe use of a HashMap comes at a cost in terms of memory. In JAVA 7, a HashMap wraps key-value pairs in Entries. An entry has:\n\na reference to a next entry\na precomputed hash (integer)\na reference to the key\na reference to the value\n\nMoreover, a JAVA 7 HashMap uses an inner array of Entry. Assuming a JAVA 7 HashMap contains N elements and its inner array has a capacity CAPACITY, the extra memory cost is approximately:\nsizeOf(integer)* N + sizeOf(reference)* (3*N+C)\nWhere:\n\nthe size of an integer depends equals 4 bytes\nthe size of a reference depends on the JVM/OS/Processor but is often 4 bytes.\nWhich means that the overhead is often 16 * N + 4 * CAPACITY bytes\n\nReminder: after an auto-resizing of the Map, the CAPACITY of the inner array equals the next power of two after N.\nNote: Since JAVA 7, the HashMap class has a lazy init. That means that even if you allocate a HashMap, the inner array of entry (that costs 4 * CAPACITY bytes) won’t be allocated in memory until the first use of the put() method.\n6.2 JAVA 8\nWith the JAVA 8 implementation, it becomes a little bit complicated to get the memory usage because a Node can contain the same data as an Entry or the same data plus 6 references and a Boolean (if it’s a TreeNode).\nIf the all the nodes are only Nodes, the memory consumption of the JAVA 8 HashMap is the same as the JAVA 7 HashMap.\nIf the all the nodes are TreeNodes, the memory consumption of a JAVA 8 HashMap becomes:\nN * sizeOf(integer) + N * sizeOf(boolean) + sizeOf(reference)* (9*N+CAPACITY )\nIn most standards JVM, it’s equal to 44 * N + 4 * CAPACITY bytes\n7. Performance issues\n7.1 Skewed HashMap vs well balanced HashMap:\nIn the best case scenario, the get() and put() methods have a O(1) cost in time complexity. But, if you don’t take care of the hash function of the key, you might end up with very slow put() and get() calls. The good performance of the put() and get depends on the repartition of the data into the different indexes of the inner array (the buckets). If the hash function of your key is ill-designed, you’ll have a skew repartition (no matter how big the capacity of the inner array is). All the put() and get() that use the biggest linked lists of entry will be slow because they’ll need to iterate the entire lists.\nIn the worst case scenario (if most of the data are in the same buckets), you could end up with a O(n) time complexity.\n7.2 Resizing overhead\nIf you need to store a lot of data, you should create your HashMap with an initial capacity close to your expected volume.\nIf you don’t do that, the Map will take the default size of 16 with a factorLoad of 0.75. The 11 first put() will be very fast but the 12th (16*0.75) will recreate a new inner array (with its associated linked lists/trees) with a new capacity of 32.

If the client cannot do anything useful, then make the exception unchecked. By useful, I mean taking steps to recover from the exception and not just logging the exception.\n\nTo summarize:\nClient's reaction when exception happens\nException type\nClient code cannot do anything\nMake it an unchecked exception\nClient code will take some useful recovery action based on information in exception\nMake it a checked exception\nMoreover, prefer unchecked exceptions for all programming errors: unchecked exceptions have the benefit of not forcing the client API to explicitly deal with them. They propagate to where you want to catch them, or they go all the way out and get reported. The Java API has many unchecked exceptions, such as NullPointerException, IllegalArgumentException, and IllegalStateException. I prefer working with standard exceptions provided in Java rather than creating my own. They make my code easy to understand and avoid increasing the memory footprint of code.\n\nPreserve encapsulation (for checked exception).\nNever let implementation-specific checked exceptions escalate to the higher layers. For example, do not propagate SQLException from data access code to the business objects layer. Business objects layer do not need to know about SQLException. You have two options:\nConvert SQLException into another checked exception, if the client code is expected to recuperate from the exception.\nConvert SQLException into an unchecked exception, if the client code cannot do anything about it.\nMost of the time, client code cannot do anything about SQLExceptions. Do not hesitate to convert them into unchecked exceptions. Consider the following piece of code:\npublic void dataAccessCode(){\ntry{..some code that throws SQLException\n\n\n}catch(SQLException ex){\nex.printStacktrace();\n}\n}\nThis catch block just suppresses the exception and does nothing. The justification is that there is nothing my client could do about an SQLException. How about dealing with it in the following manner?\npublic void dataAccessCode(){\ntry{\n..some code that throws SQLException\n}catch(SQLException ex){\nthrow new RuntimeException(ex);\n}\n}\nThis converts SQLException to RuntimeException. If SQLException occurs, the catch clause throws a new RuntimeException. The execution thread is suspended and the exception gets reported. However, I am not corrupting my business object layer with unnecessary exception handling, especially since it cannot do anything about an SQLException. If my catch needs the root exception cause, I can make use of the getCause() method.\nIf you are confident that the business layer can take some recovery action when SQLException occurs, you can convert it into a more meaningful checked exception. But I have found that just throwing RuntimeExceptionsuffices most of the time\n\nTry not to create new custom exceptions if they do not have useful information for client code.\nWhat is wrong with following code?public class DuplicateUsernameException\nextends Exception {}\n\n\nIt is not giving any useful information to the client code, other than an indicative exception name. Do not forget that Java Exception classes are like other classes, wherein you can add methods that you think the client code will invoke to get more information.\nWe could add useful methods to DuplicateUsernameException, such as:\npublic class DuplicateUsernameException\nextends Exception {\npublic DuplicateUsernameException\n(String username){....}\npublic String requestedUsername(){...}\npublic String[] availableNames(){...}\n}\nThe new version provides two useful methods: requestedUsername(), which returns the requested name, and availableNames(), which returns an array of available usernames similar to the one requested. The client could use these methods to inform that the requested username is not available and that other usernames are available. But if you are not going to add extra information, then just throw a standard exception:\nthrow new Exception(\"Username already taken\");\nEven better, if you think the client code is not going to take any action other than logging if the username is already taken, throw a unchecked exception:\nthrow new RuntimeException(\"Username already taken\");\nAlternatively, you can even provide a method that checks if the username is already taken.\nIt is worth repeating that checked exceptions are to be used in situations where the client API can take some productive action based on the information in the exception. Prefer unchecked exceptions for all programmatic errors. They make your code more readable.\n\nDocument exceptions.\nYou can use Javadoc's @throws tag to document both checked and unchecked exceptions that your API throws. However, I prefer to write unit tests to document exceptions. Tests allow me to see the exceptions in action and hence serve as documentation that can be executed. Whatever you do, have some way by which the client code can learn of the exceptions that your API throws. Here is a sample unit test that tests forIndexOutOfBoundsException:\n\npublic void testIndexOutOfBoundsException() {\nArrayList blankList = new ArrayList();\ntry {\nblankList.get(10);\nfail(\"Should raise an IndexOutOfBoundsException\");\n} catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException success) {}\n}\nThe code above should throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException when blankList.get(10) is invoked. If it does not, the fail(\"Should raise an IndexOutOfBoundsException\") statement explicitly fails the test. By writing unit tests for exceptions, you not only document how the exceptions work, but also make your code robust by testing for exceptional scenarios.\nBest Practices for Using Exceptions\nThe next set of best practices show how the client code should deal with an API that throws checked exceptions.\n\nAlways clean up after yourself\nIf you are using resources like database connections or network connections, make sure you clean them up. If the API you are invoking uses only unchecked exceptions, you should still clean up resources after use, with try -finally blocks.\n\npublic void dataAccessCode(){\nConnection conn = null;\ntry{\nconn = getConnection();\n..some code that throws SQLException\n}catch(SQLException ex){\nex.printStacktrace();\n} finally{\nDBUtil.closeConnection(conn);\n}\n}\n\nclass DBUtil{\npublic static void closeConnection\n(Connection conn){\ntry{\nconn.close();\n} catch(SQLException ex){\nlogger.error(\"Cannot close connection\");\nthrow new RuntimeException(ex);\n}\n}\n}\nDBUtil is a utility class that closes the Connection. The important point is the use of finally block, which executes whether or not an exception is caught. In this example, the finally closes the connection and throws aRuntimeException if there is problem with closing the connection.\n\nNever use exceptions for flow control\nGenerating stack traces is expensive and the value of a stack trace is in debugging. In a flow-control situation, the stack trace would be ignored, since the client just wants to know how to proceed.\nIn the code below, a custom exception, MaximumCountReachedException, is used to control the flow.\n\npublic void useExceptionsForFlowControl() {\ntry {\nwhile (true) {\nincreaseCount();\n}\n} catch (MaximumCountReachedException ex) {\n}\n//Continue execution\n}\n\npublic void increaseCount()\nthrows MaximumCountReachedException {\nif (count >= 5000)\nthrow new MaximumCountReachedException();\n}\nThe useExceptionsForFlowControl() uses an infinite loop to increase the count until the exception is thrown. This not only makes the code difficult to read, but also makes it slower. Use exception handling only in exceptional situations.\n\nDo not suppress or ignore exceptions\nWhen a method from an API throws a checked exception, it is trying to tell you that you should take some counter action. If the checked exception does not make sense to you, do not hesitate to convert it into an unchecked exception and throw it again, but do not ignore it by catching it with {} and then continue as if nothing had happened.\n\nDo not catch top-level exceptions\nUnchecked exceptions inherit from the RuntimeException class, which in turn inherits from Exception. By catching the Exception class, you are also catching RuntimeException as in the following code:\n\n\ntry{\n..\n}catch(Exception ex){\n}\nThe code above ignores unchecked exceptions, as well.\n\nAlways Log exceptions(just once)\nLogging the same exception stack trace more than once can confuse the programmer examining the stack trace about the original source of exception. So just log it once.\n\n\\\nfile path use \"/\" instead of \"\\\", so the project becomes plastform independent.\nJava Clean Code Practices:\n1) Use of descriptive and meaningful variable,method and class namesas opposed to relying too much on comments. E.g. calculateTax(BigDecimal amount), UserDAOImpl.java, etc.\nBad: List list;\nGood: List accounts;\n2) Class and functions should be small and focus on doing one thing.Do not duplicate the code. \nExample: StudentDao.java for data access logic only, Customer.java for model/entity object, StudentService.java for business logic, and CustomerValidator.java for validating input fields, etc.\nSimilarly, separate functions like calculateSalary(Long employeeId) will invoke other sub functions with meaningful names like\ncalculateBonus(Long employeeId), \ncalculateLeaves(Long employeeId), etc\n3) Methods should not take too many parameters.\nBad: processOrder(String id, String name, String address, BigDecimal price, int quantity, BigDecimal discount);\nGood: processOrder(CustomerDetail customer, OrderDetail order);\nwhere CustomerDetail is a value object with attributes like code, name etc.\n4) Use a standard code formatting template.\nShare the template across the development team.\n5) Declare the variables with the lowest possible scope.\nFor example, if a variable “temp” is used only inside a loop, then declare it inside the loop, and not outside.\n6) Don’t create variables that you don’t use again.\nExample: instead of Customer customer = repository.save(customer); \nreturn customer;\nUse: return repository.save(customer);\n7) Delete needless and commented out code. \nYou have source control for the history. \n8) Do not use System.out.println statements.\nUse proper logging frameworks like slf4j and logback for logging.\n9) Make a class final and the object immutable where possible.\nImmutable classes are thread-safe and more secured. \nFor example, the Java String class is immutable and declared as final.\n10) Minimize the accessibility of the packages, classes and its members like methods and variables.\n\nExample:private, protected, default, and public access modifiers.\nCode to interface as opposed to implementation.\nBad: ArrayList names = new ArrayList();\nGood: List names = new ArrayList();\n11) Use right data types.\nFor example, use BigDecimal instead of floating point variables like float or double for monetary values. Use enums instead of int constants.\n12) Avoid finalizers and properly override equals, hashCode, and toString methods.\nThe equals and hashCode contract must be correctly implemented to prevent hard to debug defects.\n13) Write fail-fast code by validating the input parameters.Apply design by contract.\nReturn an empty collection or throw an exception as opposed to returning a null to avoid nullpointer exceptions which are hard to debug. \n14) Security Practices:\nDon’t log sensitive data.\nClearly document security related information.\nValidate user inputs.\nFavor immutable objects.\nSecurity to prevent SQL injection attack.\nRelease resources (Streams, Connections, etc).Security to prevent denial of service attack (DoS) and resource leak issues.\nDon’t let sensitive information like file paths, server names, host names, etc escape via exceptions.\nFollow proper security best practices like SSL (one-way, two-way, etc), encrypting sensitive data, authentication/authorization, etc.\n15) Exception Handling\nUse exceptions as opposed to return codes.\nDon’t ignore or suppress exceptions. Standardize the use of checked and unchecked exceptions. Throw exceptions early and catch them late.\n17) Concurrency\nWrite thread-safe code with proper synchronization and use of immutable objects. Also, document thread-safety.\nKeep synchronization section small and favor the use of the new concurrency libraries to prevent excessive synchronization.\n18) Performance\nReuse objects via flyweight design pattern.\nBadly constructed SQL, REGEX, etc.\nInefficient Java coding and algorithms in frequently executed methods leading to death by thousand cuts.\n"},"java-quick-review/interview_questions.html":{"url":"java-quick-review/interview_questions.html","title":"Interview Questions","keywords":"","body":"Interview

一个基于数组实现的阻塞队列，它在构造时需要指定容\n量。当试图向满队列中添加元素或者从空队列中移除元素时，当前线程会被阻\n塞。通过阻塞队列，我们可以按以下模式来工作：工作者线程可以周期性的将中\n间结果放入阻塞队列中，其它线程可以取出中间结果并进行进一步操作。若工作\n者线程的执行比较慢（还没来得及向队列中插入元素），其他从队列中取元素的\n线程会等待它（试图从空队列中取元素从而阻塞）；若工作者线程执行较快（试\n图向满队列中插入元素），则它会等待其它线程取出元素再继续执行。\nwait()，sleep()的区别\nwait(): Object类中定义的实例方法。在指定对象上调用wait方法会让当前线程进\n入等待状态（前提是当前线程持有该对象的monitor），此时当前线程会释放相\n应对象的monitor，这样一来其它线程便有机会获取这个对象的monitor了。当其\n它线程获取了这个对象的monitor并进行了所需操作时，便可以调用notify方法唤\n醒之前进入等待状态的线程。\nsleep(): Thread类中的静态方法，作用是让当前线程进入休眠状态，以便让其他\n线程有机会执行。进入休眠状态的线程不会释放它所持有的锁。\n线程池的用法与优势\n优势: 实现对线程的复用，避免了反复创建及销毁线程的开销；使用线程池统一\n管理线程可以减少并发线程的数目，而线程数过多往往会在线程上下文切换上以\n及线程同步上浪费过多时间。\n用法: 我们可以调用ThreadPoolExecutor的某个构造方法来自己创建一个线程\n池。但通常情况下我们可以使用Executors类提供给我们的静态工厂方法来更方\n便的创建一个线程池对象。创建了线程池对象后，我们就可以调用submit方法提\n交任务到线程池中去执行了；线程池使用完毕后我们要记得调用shutdown方法\n来关闭它。\n关于线程池的详细介绍以及实现原理分析请点击“阅读原文”。\n\n简述Java IO与NIO的区别\nJava IO是面向流的，这意味着我们需要每次从流中读取一个或多个字节，直到\n读取完所有字节；NIO是面向缓冲的，也就是说会把数据读取到一个缓冲区中，\n然后对缓冲区中的数据进行相应处理。\nJava IO是阻塞IO，而NIO是非阻塞IO。\nJava NIO中存在一个称为选择器（selector）的东西，它允许你把多个通道\n（channel）注册到一个选择器上，然后使用一个线程来监视这些通道：若这些\n通道里有某个准备好可以开始进行读或写操作了，则开始对相应的通道进行读\n写。而在等待某通道变为可读/写期间，请求对通道进行读写操作的线程可以去\n干别的事情。\n\n反射的作用与原理\n反射的作用概括地说是运行时获取类的各种定义信息，比如定义了哪些属性与方\n法。原理是通过类的class对象来获取它的各种信息。\n\nJava 1.7与1.8的新特性\n\n常见设计模式\n所谓“设计模式”，不过是面向对象编程中一些常用的软件设计手法，并且经过实践\n的检验，这些设计手法在各自的场景下能解决一些需求，因此它们就成为了如今广\n为流传的”设计模式“。也就是说，正式因为在某些场景下产生了一些棘手的问题，才\n催生了相应的设计模式。明确了这一点，我们在学习某种设计模式时要充分理解它\n产生的背景以及它所解决的主要矛盾是什么。\n常用的设计模式可以分为以下三大类：\n创建型模式: 包括工厂模式（又可进一步分为简单工厂模式、工厂方法模式、抽\n象工厂模式）、建造者模式、单例模式。\n结构型模式: 包括适配器模式、桥接模式、装饰模式、外观模式、享元模式、代\n理模式。\n行为型模式: 包括命令模式、中介者模式、观察者模式、状态模式、策略模式。\n关于每个模式具体的介绍请点击“阅读原文”。\nJNI的基本用法\n动态代理的定义、应用场景及原理\n注解的基本概念与使用\n注解可以看作是“增强版的注释”，它可以向编译器、虚拟机说明一些事情。\n注解是描述Java代码的代码，它能够被编译器解析，注解处理工具在运行时也能\nRead more\n够解析注解。注解本身是“被动”的信息，只有主动解析它才有意义。\n除了向编译器/虚拟机传递信息，我们也可以使用注解来生成一些“模板化”的代\n码。\n\n#\n4、float f=3.4;是否正确？\n答:不正确。3.4是双精度数，将双精度型（double）赋值给浮点型（float）属于下转型（down-casting，也称为窄化）会造成精度损失，因此需要强制类型转换float f =(float)3.4; 或者写成float f =3.4F;。\n8、&和&&的区别？\n答：&运算符有两种用法：(1)按位与；(2)逻辑与。&&运算符是短路与运算。逻辑与跟短路与的差别是非常巨大的，虽然二者都要求运算符左右两端的布尔值都是true整个表达式的值才是true。&&之所以称为短路运算是因为，如果&&左边的表达式的值是false，右边的表达式会被直接短路掉，不会进行运算。很多时候我们可能都需要用&&而不是&，例如在验证用户登录时判定用户名不是null而且不是空字符串，应当写为：username != null &&!username.equals(\"\")，二者的顺序不能交换，更不能用&运算符，因为第一个条件如果不成立，根本不能进行字符串的equals比较，否则会产生NullPointerException异常。注意：逻辑或运算符（|）和短路或运算符（||）的差别也是如此。\n补充：如果你熟悉JavaScript，那你可能更能感受到短路运算的强大，想成为JavaScript的高手就先从玩转短路运算开始吧。\n9、解释内存中的栈(stack)、堆(heap)和方法区(method area)的用法。\n答：通常我们定义一个基本数据类型的变量，一个对象的引用，还有就是函数调用的现场保存都使用JVM中的栈空间；而通过new关键字和构造器创建的对象则放在堆空间，堆是垃圾收集器管理的主要区域，由于现在的垃圾收集器都采用分代收集算法，所以堆空间还可以细分为新生代和老生代，再具体一点可以分为Eden、Survivor（又可分为From Survivor和To Survivor）、Tenured；方法区和堆都是各个线程共享的内存区域，用于存储已经被JVM加载的类信息、常量、静态变量、JIT编译器编译后的代码等数据；程序中的字面量（literal）如直接书写的100、\"hello\"和常量都是放在常量池中，常量池是方法区的一部分，。栈空间操作起来最快但是栈很小，通常大量的对象都是放在堆空间，栈和堆的大小都可以通过JVM的启动参数来进行调整，栈空间用光了会引发StackOverflowError，而堆和常量池空间不足则会引发OutOfMemoryError。\nString str = new String(\"hello\");\n上面的语句中变量str放在栈上，用new创建出来的字符串对象放在堆上，而\"hello\"这个字面量是放在方法区的。\n补充1：较新版本的Java（从Java 6的某个更新开始）中，由于JIT编译器的发展和\"逃逸分析\"技术的逐渐成熟，栈上分配、标量替换等优化技术使得对象一定分配在堆上这件事情已经变得不那么绝对了。\n\n补充2：运行时常量池相当于Class文件常量池具有动态性，Java语言并不要求常量一定只有编译期间才能产生，运行期间也可以将新的常量放入池中，String类的intern()方法就是这样的。\n看看下面代码的执行结果是什么并且比较一下Java 7以前和以后的运行结果是否一致。\nString s1 = new StringBuilder(\"go\")\n    .append(\"od\").toString();\nSystem.out.println(s1.intern() == s1);String s2 = new StringBuilder(\"ja\")\n    .append(\"va\").toString();\nSystem.out.println(s2.intern() == s2);\n11、switch 是否能作用在byte 上，是否能作用在long 上，是否能作用在String上？\n答：在Java 5以前，switch(expr)中，expr只能是byte、short、char、int。从Java 5开始，Java中引入了枚举类型，expr也可以是enum类型，从Java 7开始，expr还可以是字符串（String），\n但是长整型（long）在目前所有的版本中都是不可以的。\n12、用最有效率的方法计算2乘以8？\n答： 2 \n补充：我们为编写的类重写hashCode方法时，可能会看到如下所示的代码，其实我们不太理解为什么要使用这样的乘法运算来产生哈希码（散列码），\n而且为什么这个数是个素数，为什么通常选择31这个数？前两个问题的答案你可以自己百度一下，选择31是因为可以用移位和减法运算来代替乘法，从而得到更好的性能。\n说到这里你可能已经想到了：31 * num 等价于(num public class PhoneNumber {\n    private int areaCode;\n    private String prefix;\n    private String lineNumber;\n@Override\npublic int hashCode() {\n    final int prime = 31;\n    int result = 1;\n    result = prime * result + areaCode;\n    result = prime * result\n            + ((lineNumber == null) ? 0 : lineNumber.hashCode());\n    result = prime * result + ((prefix == null) ? 0 : prefix.hashCode());\n    return result;\n}\n\n@Override\npublic boolean equals(Object obj) {\n    if (this == obj)\n        return true;\n    if (obj == null)\n        return false;\n    if (getClass() != obj.getClass())\n        return false;\n    PhoneNumber other = (PhoneNumber) obj;\n    if (areaCode != other.areaCode)\n        return false;\n    if (lineNumber == null) {\n        if (other.lineNumber != null)\n            return false;\n    } else if (!lineNumber.equals(other.lineNumber))\n        return false;\n    if (prefix == null) {\n        if (other.prefix != null)\n            return false;\n    } else if (!prefix.equals(other.prefix))\n        return false;\n    return true;\n}\n}\n14、在Java中，如何跳出当前的多重嵌套循环？\n答：在最外层循环前加一个标记如A，然后用break A;可以跳出多重循环。（Java中支持带标签的break和continue语句，作用有点类似于C和C++中的goto语句，\n但是就像要避免使用goto一样，应该避免使用带标签的break和continue，因为它不会让你的程序变得更优雅，很多时候甚至有相反的作用，所以这种语法其实不知道更好）\n15、构造器（constructor）是否可被重写（override）？\n答：构造器不能被继承，因此不能被重写，但可以被重载。\n16、两个对象值相同(x.equals(y) == true)，但却可有不同的hash code，这句话对不对？\n答：不对，如果两个对象x和y满足x.equals(y) == true，它们的哈希码（hash code）应当相同。Java对于eqauls方法和hashCode方法是这样规定的：\n(1)如果两个对象相同（equals方法返回true），那么它们的hashCode值一定要相同；(2)如果两个对象的hashCode相同，它们并不一定相同。当然，你未必要按照要求去做，\n但是如果你违背了上述原则就会发现在使用容器时，相同的对象可以出现在Set集合中，同时增加新元素的效率会大大下降（对于使用哈希存储的系统，如果哈希码频繁的冲突将会造成存取性能急剧下降）。\n补充：关于equals和hashCode方法，很多Java程序都知道，但很多人也就是仅仅知道而已，在Joshua Bloch的大作《Effective Java》\n（很多软件公司，《Effective Java》、《Java编程思想》以及《重构：改善既有代码质量》是Java程序员必看书籍，如果你还没看过，那就赶紧去亚马逊买一本吧）\n中是这样介绍equals方法的：首先equals方法必须满足自反性（x.equals(x)必须返回true）、对称性（x.equals(y)返回true时，y.equals(x)也必须返回true）、\n传递性（x.equals(y)和y.equals(z)都返回true时，x.equals(z)也必须返回true）和一致性（当x和y引用的对象信息没有被修改时，多次调用x.equals(y)应该得到同样的返回值），\n而且对于任何非null值的引用x，x.equals(null)必须返回false。实现高质量的equals方法的诀窍包括：\n1. 使用==操作符检查\"参数是否为这个对象的引用\"；\n2. 使用instanceof操作符检查\"参数是否为正确的类型\"；\n3. 对于类中的关键属性，检查参数传入对象的属性是否与之相匹配；\n4. 编写完equals方法后，问自己它是否满足对称性、传递性、一致性；\n5. 重写equals时总是要重写hashCode；\n6. 不要将equals方法参数中的Object对象替换为其他的类型，在重写时不要忘掉@Override注解。\n18、当一个对象被当作参数传递到一个方法后，此方法可改变这个对象的属性，并可返回变化后的结果，那么这里到底是值传递还是引用传递？\n答：是值传递。Java语言的方法调用只支持参数的值传递。当一个对象实例作为一个参数被传递到方法中时，参数的值就是对该对象的引用。对象的属性可以在被调用过程中被改变，但对对象引用的改变是不会影响到调用者的。C++和C#中可以通过传引用或传输出参数来改变传入的参数的值。在C#中可以编写如下所示的代码，但是在Java中却做不到。\nusing System;\nnamespace CS01 {\n    class Program {\n        public static void swap(ref int x, ref int y) {\n            int temp = x;\n            x = y;\n            y = temp;\n        }\n        public static void Main (string[] args) {\n            int a = 5, b = 10;\n            swap (ref a, ref b);\n            // a = 10, b = 5;\n            Console.WriteLine (\"a = {0}, b = {1}\", a, b);\n        }\n    }\n}\n说明：Java中没有传引用实在是非常的不方便，这一点在Java 8中仍然没有得到改进，正是如此在Java编写的代码中才会出现大量的Wrapper类\n（将需要通过方法调用修改的引用置于一个Wrapper类中，再将Wrapper对象传入方法），\n这样的做法只会让代码变得臃肿，尤其是让从C和C++转型为Java程序员的开发者无法容忍。\n21、描述一下JVM加载class文件的原理机制？\n答：JVM中类的装载是由类加载器（ClassLoader）和它的子类来实现的，Java中的类加载器是一个重要的Java运行时系统组件，它负责在运行时查找和装入类文件中的类。\n由于Java的跨平台性，经过编译的Java源程序并不是一个可执行程序，而是一个或多个类文件。当Java程序需要使用某个类时，JVM会确保这个类已经被加载、连接（验证、准备和解析）和初始化。类的加载是指把类的.class文件中的数据读入到内存中，通常是创建一个字节数组读入.class文件，然后产生与所加载类对应的Class对象。加载完成后，Class对象还不完整，所以此时的类还不可用。当类被加载后就进入连接阶段，这一阶段包括验证、准备（为静态变量分配内存并设置默认的初始值）和解析（将符号引用替换为直接引用）三个步骤。最后JVM对类进行初始化，包括：1)如果类存在直接的父类并且这个类还没有被初始化，那么就先初始化父类；2)如果类中存在初始化语句，就依次执行这些初始化语句。\n类的加载是由类加载器完成的，类加载器包括：根加载器（BootStrap）、扩展加载器（Extension）、系统加载器（System）和用户自定义类加载器（java.lang.ClassLoader的子类）。从Java 2（JDK 1.2）开始，类加载过程采取了父亲委托机制（PDM）。PDM更好的保证了Java平台的安全性，在该机制中，JVM自带的Bootstrap是根加载器，其他的加载器都有且仅有一个父类加载器。类的加载首先请求父类加载器加载，父类加载器无能为力时才由其子类加载器自行加载。JVM不会向Java程序提供对Bootstrap的引用。下面是关于几个类加载器的说明：\n    Bootstrap：一般用本地代码实现，负责加载JVM基础核心类库（rt.jar）；\n\n    Extension：从java.ext.dirs系统属性所指定的目录中加载类库，它的父加载器是Bootstrap；\n\n    System：又叫应用类加载器，其父类是Extension。它是应用最广泛的类加载器。它从环境变量classpath或者系统属性java.class.path所指定的目录中记载类，是用户自定义加载器的默认父加载器。\n22、char 型变量中能不能存贮一个中文汉字，为什么？\n答：char类型可以存储一个中文汉字，因为Java中使用的编码是Unicode（不选择任何特定的编码，直接使用字符在字符集中的编号，这是统一的唯一方法），\n一个char类型占2个字节（16比特），所以放一个中文是没问题的。\n补充：使用Unicode意味着字符在JVM内部和外部有不同的表现形式，在JVM内部都是Unicode，当这个字符被从JVM内部转移到外部时（\n例如存入文件系统中），需要进行编码转换。所以Java中有字节流和字符流，以及在字符流和字节流之间进行转换的转换流，\n如InputStreamReader和OutputStreamReader，这两个类是字节流和字符流之间的适配器类，承担了编码转换的任务；\n对于C程序员来说，要完成这样的编码转换恐怕要依赖于union（联合体/共用体）共享内存的特征来实现了。\n24、静态嵌套类(Static Nested Class)和内部类（Inner Class）的不同？\n答：Static Nested Class是被声明为静态（static）的内部类，它可以不依赖于外部类实例被实例化。\n而通常的内部类需要在外部类实例化后才能实例化，其语法看起来挺诡异的，如下所示。\n/**\n\n扑克类（一副扑克）\n@author 骆昊\n\n/\npublic class Poker {\n

}\n}\n面试题 - 下面的代码哪些地方会产生编译错误？\nclass Outer {\n    class Inner {}\n    public static void foo() { new Inner(); }\n    public void bar() { new Inner(); }\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        new Inner();\n    }\n}\n注意：Java中非静态内部类对象的创建要依赖其外部类对象，上面的面试题中foo和main方法都是静态方法，静态方法中没有this，也就是说没有所谓的外部类对象，因此无法创建内部类对象，如果要在静态方法中创建内部类对象，可以这样做：\n\nnew Outer().new Inner();\n26、抽象的（abstract）方法是否可同时是静态的（static）,是否可同时是本地方法（native），是否可同时被synchronized修饰？\n答：都不能。抽象方法需要子类重写，而静态的方法是无法被重写的，因此二者是矛盾的。本地方法是由本地代码（如C代码）实现的方法，而抽象方法是没有实现的，也是矛盾的。\nsynchronized和方法的实现细节有关，抽象方法不涉及实现细节，因此也是相互矛盾的。\n27、阐述静态变量和实例变量的区别。\n答：静态变量是被static修饰符修饰的变量，也称为类变量，它属于类，不属于类的任何一个对象，一个类不管创建多少个对象，静态变量在内存中有且仅有一个拷贝；\n实例变量必须依存于某一实例，需要先创建对象然后通过对象才能访问到它。静态变量可以实现让多个对象共享内存。\n补充：在Java开发中，上下文类和工具类中通常会有大量的静态成员。\n28、是否可以从一个静态（static）方法内部发出对非静态（non-static）方法的调用？\n答：不可以，静态方法只能访问静态成员，因为非静态方法的调用要先创建对象，在调用静态方法时可能对象并没有被初始化。\n29、如何实现对象克隆？\n答：有两种方式：\n  1). 实现Cloneable接口并重写Object类中的clone()方法；\n  2). 实现Serializable接口，通过对象的序列化和反序列化实现克隆，可以实现真正的深度克隆，代码如下。\nimport java.io.ByteArrayInputStream;\nimport java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;import java.io.ObjectInputStream;\nimport java.io.ObjectOutputStream;\nimport java.io.Serializable;\npublic class MyUtil {\n    private MyUtil() {\n        throw new AssertionError();\n    }\n    @SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")\n    public static  T clone(T obj) throws Exception {\n        ByteArrayOutputStream bout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\n        ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(bout);\n        oos.writeObject(obj);\n        ByteArrayInputStream bin = new ByteArrayInputStream(bout.toByteArray());\n        ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(bin);\n        return (T) ois.readObject();\n        // 说明：调用ByteArrayInputStream或ByteArrayOutputStream对象的close方法没有任何意义\n        // 这两个基于内存的流只要垃圾回收器清理对象就能够释放资源，这一点不同于对外部资源（如文件流）的释放\n    }\n}\n下面是测试代码：\nimport java.io.Serializable;\n/**\n\n人类\n@author 骆昊\n\n/\nclass Person implements Serializable {\n private static final long serialVersionUID = -9102017020286042305L;\n private

}\n}\n注意：基于序列化和反序列化实现的克隆不仅仅是深度克隆，更重要的是通过泛型限定，可以检查出要克隆的对象是否支持序列化，这项检查是编译器完成的，\n不是在运行时抛出异常，这种是方案明显优于使用Object类的clone方法克隆对象。让问题在编译的时候暴露出来总是好过把问题留到运行时。\n31、String s = new String(\"xyz\");创建了几个字符串对象？\n答：两个对象，一个是静态区的\"xyz\"，一个是用new创建在堆上的对象。\n32、接口是否可继承（extends）接口？抽象类是否可实现（implements）接口？抽象类是否可继承具体类（concrete class）？\n答：接口可以继承接口，而且支持多重继承。抽象类可以实现(implements)接口，抽象类可继承具体类也可以继承抽象类。\n33、一个\".java\"源文件中是否可以包含多个类（不是内部类）？有什么限制？\n答：可以，但一个源文件中最多只能有一个公开类（public class）而且文件名必须和公开类的类名完全保持一致。\n34、Anonymous Inner Class(匿名内部类)是否可以继承其它类？是否可以实现接口？\n答：可以继承其他类或实现其他接口，在Swing编程和Android开发中常用此方式来实现事件监听和回调。\n35、内部类可以引用它的包含类（外部类）的成员吗？有没有什么限制？\n答：一个内部类对象可以访问创建它的外部类对象的成员，包括私有成员。\n37、指出下面程序的运行结果。\nclass A {    static {\n        System.out.print(\"1\");\n    }\n    public A() {\n        System.out.print(\"2\");\n    }\n}\nclass B extends A{\n    static {\n        System.out.print(\"a\");\n    }\n    public B() {\n

}\n}\n答：执行结果：1a2b2b。创建对象时构造器的调用顺序是：先初始化静态成员，然后调用父类构造器，再初始化非静态成员，最后调用自身构造器。\n提示：如果不能给出此题的正确答案，说明之前第21题Java类加载机制还没有完全理解，赶紧再看看吧。\n38、数据类型之间的转换：\n\n如何将字符串转换为基本数据类型？\n如何将基本数据类型转换为字符串？\n答：\n调用基本数据类型对应的包装类中的方法parseXXX(String)或valueOf(String)即可返回相应基本类型；\n一种方法是将基本数据类型与空字符串（\"\"）连接（+）即可获得其所对应的字符串；另一种方法是调用String 类中的valueOf()方法返回相应字符串\n\n39、如何实现字符串的反转及替换？\n答：方法很多，可以自己写实现也可以使用String或StringBuffer/StringBuilder中的方法。有一道很常见的面试题是用递归实现字符串反转，代码如下所示：\npublic static String reverse(String originStr) {\n        if(originStr == null || originStr.length() \n40、怎样将GB2312编码的字符串转换为ISO-8859-1编码的字符串？\n答：代码如下所示：\nString s1 = \"你好\";\nString s2 = new String(s1.getBytes(\"GB2312\"), \"ISO-8859-1\");\n43、比较一下Java和JavaSciprt。\n答：JavaScript 与Java是两个公司开发的不同的两个产品。Java 是原Sun Microsystems公司推出的面向对象的程序设计语言，特别适合于互联网应用程序开发；而JavaScript是Netscape公司的产品，为了扩展Netscape浏览器的功能而开发的一种可以嵌入Web页面中运行的基于对象和事件驱动的解释性语言。JavaScript的前身是LiveScript；而Java的前身是Oak语言。\n下面对两种语言间的异同作如下比较：\n\n基于对象和面向对象：Java是一种真正的面向对象的语言，即使是开发简单的程序，必须设计对象；JavaScript是种脚本语言，它可以用来制作与网络无关的，与用户交互作用的复杂软件。它是一种基于对象（Object-Based）和事件驱动（Event-Driven）的编程语言，因而它本身提供了非常丰富的内部对象供设计人员使用。\n解释和编译：Java的源代码在执行之前，必须经过编译。JavaScript是一种解释性编程语言，其源代码不需经过编译，由浏览器解释执行。（目前的浏览器几乎都使用了JIT（即时编译）技术来提升JavaScript的运行效率）\n强类型变量和类型弱变量：Java采用强类型变量检查，即所有变量在编译之前必须作声明；JavaScript中变量是弱类型的，甚至在使用变量前可以不作声明，JavaScript的解释器在运行时检查推断其数据类型。\n代码格式不一样。\n  补充：上面列出的四点是网上流传的所谓的标准答案。其实Java和JavaScript最重要的区别是一个是静态语言，一个是动态语言。\n  目前的编程语言的发展趋势是函数式语言和动态语言。在Java中类（class）是一等公民，而JavaScript中函数（function）是一等公民，因此JavaScript支持函数式编程，可以使用Lambda函数和闭包（closure），当然Java 8也开始支持函数式编程，提供了对Lambda表达式以及函数式接口的支持。对于这类问题，在面试的时候最好还是用自己的语言回答会更加靠谱，不要背网上所谓的标准答案。\n\n\n44、什么时候用断言（assert）？\n答：断言在软件开发中是一种常用的调试方式，很多开发语言中都支持这种机制。一般来说，断言用于保证程序最基本、关键的正确性。断言检查通常在开发和测试时开启。\n为了保证程序的执行效率，在软件发布后断言检查通常是关闭的。断言是一个包含布尔表达式的语句，在执行这个语句时假定该表达式为true；如果表达式的值为false，\n那么系统会报告一个AssertionError。断言的使用如下面的代码所示：\nassert(a > 0); // throws an AssertionError if a \n断言可以有两种形式：\nassert Expression1;\nassert Expression1 : Expression2 ;\nExpression1 应该总是产生一个布尔值。\nExpression2 可以是得出一个值的任意表达式；这个值用于生成显示更多调试信息的字符串消息。\n要在运行时启用断言，可以在启动JVM时使用-enableassertions或者-ea标记。要在运行时选择禁用断言，可以在启动JVM时使用-da或者-disableassertions标记。要在系统类中启用或禁用断言，可使用-esa或-dsa标记。还可以在包的基础上启用或者禁用断言。\n注意：断言不应该以任何方式改变程序的状态。简单的说，如果希望在不满足某些条件时阻止代码的执行，就可以考虑用断言来阻止它。\n73、XML文档定义有几种形式？它们之间有何本质区别？解析XML文档有哪几种方式？\n答：XML文档定义分为DTD和Schema两种形式，二者都是对XML语法的约束，其本质区别在于Schema本身也是一个XML文件，可以被XML解析器解析，而且可以为XML承载的数据定义类型，约束能力较之DTD更强大。对XML的解析主要有DOM（文档对象模型，Document Object Model）、SAX（Simple API for XML）和StAX（Java 6中引入的新的解析XML的方式，Streaming API for XML），其中DOM处理大型文件时其性能下降的非常厉害，这个问题是由DOM树结构占用的内存较多造成的，而且DOM解析方式必须在解析文件之前把整个文档装入内存，适合对XML的随机访问（典型的用空间换取时间的策略）；SAX是事件驱动型的XML解析方式，它顺序读取XML文件，不需要一次全部装载整个文件。当遇到像文件开头，文档结束，或者标签开头与标签结束时，它会触发一个事件，用户通过事件回调代码来处理XML文件，适合对XML的顺序访问；顾名思义，StAX把重点放在流上，实际上StAX与其他解析方式的本质区别就在于应用程序能够把XML作为一个事件流来处理。将XML作为一组事件来处理的想法并不新颖（SAX就是这样做的），但不同之处在于StAX允许应用程序代码把这些事件逐个拉出来，而不用提供在解析器方便时从解析器中接收事件的处理程序。\n74、你在项目中哪些地方用到了XML？\n答：XML的主要作用有两个方面：数据交换和信息配置。在做数据交换时，XML将数据用标签组装成起来，然后压缩打包加密后通过网络传送给接收者，接收解密与解压缩后再从XML文件中还原相关信息进行处理，XML曾经是异构系统间交换数据的事实标准，但此项功能几乎已经被JSON（JavaScript Object Notation）取而代之。当然，目前很多软件仍然使用XML来存储配置信息，我们在很多项目中通常也会将作为配置信息的硬代码写在XML文件中，Java的很多框架也是这么做的，而且这些框架都选择了dom4j作为处理XML的工具，因为Sun公司的官方API实在不怎么好用。\n补充：现在有很多时髦的软件（如Sublime）已经开始将配置文件书写成JSON格式，我们已经强烈的感受到XML的另一项功能也将逐渐被业界抛弃。\n83、简述正则表达式及其用途。\n答：在编写处理字符串的程序时，经常会有查找符合某些复杂规则的字符串的需要。正则表达式就是用于描述这些规则的工具。换句话说，正则表达式就是记录文本规则的代码。\n说明：计算机诞生初期处理的信息几乎都是数值，但是时过境迁，今天我们使用计算机处理的信息更多的时候不是数值而是字符串，正则表达式就是在进行字符串匹配和处理的时候最为强大的工具，绝大多数语言都提供了对正则表达式的支持。\n84、Java中是如何支持正则表达式操作的？\n答：Java中的String类提供了支持正则表达式操作的方法，包括：matches()、replaceAll()、replaceFirst()、split()。此外，Java中可以用Pattern类表示正则表达式对象，它提供了丰富的API进行各种正则表达式操作，请参考下面面试题的代码。\n面试题： - 如果要从字符串中截取第一个英文左括号之前的字符串，例如：北京市(朝阳区)(西城区)(海淀区)，截取结果为：北京市，那么正则表达式怎么写？\nimport java.util.regex.Matcher;import java.util.regex.Pattern;\nclass RegExpTest {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String str = \"北京市(朝阳区)(西城区)(海淀区)\";\n        Pattern p = Pattern.compile(\".*?(?=\\()\");\n        Matcher m = p.matcher(str);\n        if(m.find()) {\n            System.out.println(m.group());\n        }\n    }\n}\n14\n\n    说明：上面的正则表达式中使用了懒惰匹配和前瞻，如果不清楚这些内容，推荐读一下网上很有名的《正则表达式30分钟入门教程》。\n\n85、获得一个类的类对象有哪些方式？\n答：\n- 方法1：类型.class，例如：String.class\n- 方法2：对象.getClass()，例如：\"hello\".getClass()\n- 方法3：Class.forName()，例如：Class.forName(\"java.lang.String\")\n\n86、如何通过反射创建对象？\n答：\n- 方法1：通过类对象调用newInstance()方法，例如：String.class.newInstance()\n- 方法2：通过类对象的getConstructor()或getDeclaredConstructor()方法获得构造器（Constructor）对象并调用其newInstance()方法创建对象，例如：String.class.getConstructor(String.class).newInstance(\"Hello\");\n\n87、如何通过反射获取和设置对象私有字段的值？\n答：可以通过类对象的getDeclaredField()方法字段（Field）对象，然后再通过字段对象的setAccessible(true)将其设置为可以访问，接下来就可以通过get/set方法来获取/设置字段的值了。下面的代码实现了一个反射的工具类，其中的两个静态方法分别用于获取和设置私有字段的值，字段可以是基本类型也可以是对象类型且支持多级对象操作，例如ReflectionUtil.get(dog, \"owner.car.engine.id\");可以获得dog对象的主人的汽车的引擎的ID号。\nimport java.lang.reflect.Constructor;\nimport java.lang.reflect.Field;\nimport java.lang.reflect.Modifier;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport
